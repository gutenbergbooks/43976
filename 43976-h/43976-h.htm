<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The number and the importance of the discoveries which have
been made in the course of the last five or six years in the realm
of Fossil Botany have largely altered the aspect of the subject and
greatly widened its horizon. Until comparatively recent times the
rather narrow outlook and the technical difficulties of the study
made it one which could only be appreciated by specialists. This
has been gradually changed, owing to the detailed anatomical work
which it was found possible to do on the carboniferous plants, and
which proved to be of great botanical importance. About ten
years ago textbooks in English were written, and the subject was
included in the work of the honours students of Botany at the
Universities. To-day the important bearing of the results of this
branch of Science on several others, as well as its intrinsic value,
is so much greater, that anyone who is at all acquainted with
general science, and more particularly with Botany and Geology,
must find much to interest him in it.</p>
<p>There is no book in the English language which places this
really attractive subject before the non-specialist, and to do so
is the aim of the present volume. The two excellent English
books which we possess, viz. Seward&rsquo;s <i>Fossil Plants</i> (of which
the first volume only has appeared, and that ten years ago) and
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Studies in Fossil Botany</i>, are ideal for advanced University
students. But they are written for students who are supposed to
have a previous knowledge of technical botany, and prove very
hard or impossible reading for those who are merely acquainted
with Science in a general way, or for less advanced students.</p>
<p>The inclusion of fossil types in the South Kensington syllabus
for Botany indicates the increasing importance attached to pal&aelig;obotany,
and as vital facts about several of those types are not to
be found in a simply written book, the students preparing for the
examination must find some difficulty in getting their information.
Furthermore, Scott&rsquo;s book, the only up-to-date one, does not give
a complete survey of the subject, but just selects the more important
families to describe in detail.</p>
<p>Hence the present book was attempted for the double purpose
of presenting the most interesting discoveries and general conclusions
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
of recent years, and bringing together the subject as a
whole.</p>
<p>The mass of information which has been collected about fossil
plants is now enormous, and the greatest difficulty in writing this
little book has been the necessity of eliminating much that is of
great interest. The author awaits with fear and trembling the
criticisms of specialists, who will probably find that many things
considered by them as particularly interesting or essential have
been left out. It is hoped that they will bear in mind the scope
and aim of the book. I try to present only the structure raised
on the foundation of the accumulated details of specialists&rsquo; work,
and not to demonstrate brick by brick the exposed foundation.</p>
<p>Though the book is not written specially for them, it is probable
that University students may find it useful as a general survey of
the whole subject, for there is much in it that can only be learned
otherwise by reference to innumerable original monographs.</p>
<p>In writing this book all possible sources of information have
been consulted, and though Scott&rsquo;s <i>Studies</i><a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
naturally formed the
foundation of some of the chapters on Pteridophytes, the authorities
for all the general part and the recent discoveries are the numerous
memoirs published by many different learned societies here and
abroad.</p>
<p>As these pages are primarily for the use of those who have no
very technical preliminary training, the simplest language possible
which is consistent with a concise style has always been adopted.
The necessary technical terms are either explained in the context
or in the glossary at the end of the book. The list of the more
important authorities makes no pretence of including all the references
that might be consulted with advantage, but merely indicates
the more important volumes and papers which anyone should read
who wishes to follow up the subject.</p>
<p>All the illustrations are made for the book itself, and I am
much obliged to Mr. D. M. S. Watson, B.Sc., for the microphotos
of plant anatomy which adorn its pages. The figures and diagram
are my own work.</p>
<p>This book is dedicated to college students, to the senior pupils
of good schools where the subject is beginning to find a place in
the higher courses of Botany, but especially to all those who take
an interest in plant evolution because it forms a thread in the web
of life whose design they wish to trace.</p>

<h1 title="">ANCIENT PLANTS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>
<p>The lore of the plants which have successively
clothed this ancient earth during the thousands of
centuries before men appeared is generally ignored or
tossed on one side with a contemptuous comment on
the dullness and &ldquo;dryness&rdquo; of fossil botany.</p>
<p>It is true that all that remains of the once luxuriant
vegetation are fragments preserved in stone, fragments
which often show little of beauty or value to the untrained
eye; but nevertheless these fragments can tell
a story of great interest when once we have the clue
to their meaning.</p>
<p>The plants which lived when the world was young
were not the same as those which live to-day, yet they
filled much the same place in the economy of nature,
and were as vitally important to the animals then depending
on them as are the plants which are now indispensable
to man. To-day the life of the modern
plants interests many people, and even philosophers
have examined the structure of their bodies and have
pondered over the great unanswered questions of the
cause and the course of their evolution. But all the
plants which are now alive are the descendants of those
which lived a few years ago, and those again came down
through generation after generation from the plants which
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
inhabited the world before the races of men existed. If,
therefore, we wish to know and understand the vegetation
living to-day we must look into the past histories of
the families of plants, and there is no way to do this at
once so simple and so direct (in theory) as to examine
the remains of the plants which actually lived in that
past. Yet when we come to do this practically we
encounter many difficulties, which have discouraged all
but enthusiasts from attempting the study hitherto, but
which in reality need not dismay us.</p>
<p>When Lindley and Hutton, in 1831, began to publish
their classical book <i>The Fossil Flora of Great Britain</i>,
they could give but isolated fragments of information
concerning the fossils they described, and the results of
their work threw but little light on the theoretical problems
of morphology and classification of living plants.
Since then great advance has been made, and now the
sum of our knowledge of the subject, though far from
complete, is so considerable and has such a far-reaching
influence that it is becoming the chief inspiration of
several branches of modern botany. Of the many
workers who have contributed to this stock of knowledge
the foremost, as he was the pioneer in the investigations
on modern lines, is Williamson, who was a professor at
Manchester University, and whose monographs and specimens
are classics to-day. Still living is Dr. Scott, whose
greatness is scarcely less, as well as an ever-increasing
number of specialists in this country, who are continually
making discoveries. Abroad, the chief Continental names
are Renault, Bertrand, Count Solms Laubach, Brongniart,
Zeiller; and in America is Dr. Wieland; while there
are innumerable other workers in the field who have
deepened and widened the channels of information.
The literature on fossil plants is now vast; so great that
to give merely the names of the publications would fill a
very large volume.</p>
<p>But, like the records left by the plants themselves,
most of this literature is unreadable by any but specialists,
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and its really vital interest is enclosed in a petrifying
medium of technicalities. It is to give their results
in a more accessible form that the present volume has
been written.</p>
<p>The actual plants that lived and died long ago have
left either no trace of their form and character, or but
imperfect fragments of some of their parts embedded in
hard rock and often hidden deep in the earth. That
such difficulties lie in our way should not discourage us
from attempting to learn all the fossils can teach. Many
an old manuscript which is torn and partly destroyed
bears a record, the fragments of which are more interesting
and important than a tale told by a complete new
book. The very difficulty of the subject of fossil botany
is in itself an incentive to study, and the obstacles to be
surmounted before a view of the ancient plants can be
seen increase the fascination of the journey.</p>
<p>The world of to-day has been nearly explored; but
the world, or rather the innumerable world-phases of the
past, lie before us practically unknown, bewilderingly
enticing in their mystery. These untrodden regions are
revealed to us only by the fossils lying scattered through
the rocks at our feet, which give us the clues to guide us
along an adventurous path.</p>
<p>Fables of flying dragons and wondrous sea monsters
have been shown by the students of animal fossils to be
no more marvellous than were the actual creatures which
once inhabited the globe; and among the plants such
wonderful monsters have their parallels in the floras of
the past. The trees which are living to-day are very
recent in comparison with the ancestors of the families
of lowlier plants, and most of the modern forest trees have
usurped a position which once belonged to the monster
members of such families as the Lycopods and Equisetums,
which are now humble and dwindling. An ancient
giant of the past is seen in the <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>, and the great
girth of its stem offers a striking contrast to the feeble
trailing branches of its living relatives, the Club-mosses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>As we follow their histories we shall see how family
after family has risen to dominate the forest, and has in
its turn given place to a succeeding group. Some of the
families that flourished long since have living descendants
of dwarfed and puny growth, others have died out completely,
so that their very existence would have been
unsuspected had it not been revealed by their broken
fragments entombed in the rocks.</p>
<p>From the study of the fossils, also, we can discover
something of the course of the evolution of the different
parts of the plant body, from the changes it has passed
through in the countless ages of its existence. Just as
the dominant animals of the past had bodies lacking in
many of the characters which are most important to the
living animals, so did the early plants differ from those
around us to-day. It is the comparative study of living
and fossil structures which throws the strongest light on
the facts and factors of evolution.</p>
<p>When the study of fossil organisms goes into minute
detail and embraces the fine subtleties of their internal
structure, then the student of fossil plants has the advantage
of the zoological observer, for in many of the
fossil plants the cells themselves are petrified with a
perfection that no fossil animal tissues have yet been
found to approach. Under the microscope the most
delicate of plant cells, the patterns on their walls, and
sometimes even their nuclei can be recognized as
clearly as if they were living tissues. The value of this
is immense, because the external appearance of leaves
and stems is often very deceptive, and only when both
external appearance and internal structure are known
can a real estimate of the character of the plant be
made. In the following chapters a number of photographs
taken through the microscope will show some
of the cell structure from fossil plants. Such figures
as <a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a> and <a href="#fig96">fig. 96</a>, for example, illustrate the excellence
of preservation which is often found in petrified
plant tissues. Indeed, the microscope becomes an essential
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
part of the equipment of a fossil botanist; as it is to
a student of living plants. But for those who are not
intending to specialize on the subject micro-photographs
will illustrate sufficient detail, while in most modern
museums some excellently preserved specimens are exhibited
which show their structure if examined with a
magnifying glass.</p>
<p>We recognize to-day the effect the vegetation of a
district has on its scenery, even on its more fundamental
nature; and we see how the plants keep in close harmony
with the lands and waters, the climates and soils of
the places they inhabit. So was it in the past. Hence
the fossil plants of a district will throw much light on
its physical characters during the epoch when they were
living, and from their evidence it is possible to build up
a picture of the conditions of a region during the epochs
of its unwritten history.</p>
<p>From every point of view a student of living plants
will find his knowledge and understanding of them
greatly increased by a study of the fossils. Not only
to the botanist is the subject of value, the geologist is
equally concerned with it, though from a slightly different
viewpoint, and all students of the past history of the
earth will gain from it a wider knowledge of their
specialty.</p>
<p>To all observers of life, to all philosophers, the whole
history of plants, which only approaches completion when
the fossils are studied, and compared or contrasted with
living forms, affords a wonderful illustration of the laws
of evolution on which are based most of the modern
conceptions of life. Even to those whose profession
necessitates purely practical lines of thought, fossil botany
has something to teach; the study of coal, for instance,
comes within its boundaries. While to all who think on
the world at all, the story told by the fossil plants is a
chapter in the Book of Life which is as well worth
reading as any in that mystical volume.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">VARIOUS KINDS OF FOSSIL PLANTS</span></h2>
<p>Of the rocks which form the solid earth of to-day,
a very large proportion have been built up from the
deposits at the bottom of ancient oceans and lakes.
The earth is very old, and in the course of its history
dry land and sea, mountains and valleys have been
formed and again destroyed on the same spot, and it
is from the silt at the bottom of an ocean that the hills
of the future are built.</p>
<p>The chief key we have to the processes that were
in operation in the past is the course of events passing
under our eyes to-day. Hence, if we would understand
the formation of the rocks in the ancient seas, we must
go to the shores of the modern ones and see what is
taking place there. One of the most noticeable characters
of a shore is the line of flotsam that is left by the
edge of the waves; here you may find all kinds of land
plants mixed with the sea shells and general rubbish,
plants that may have drifted far. Much of the d&eacute;bris
(outside towns) is brought down by the rivers, and may
be carried some distance out to sea; then part becomes
waterlogged and sinks, and part floats in to shore, perhaps
to be carried out again, or to be buried under the
coarse sand of the beach. When we examine sandstone
rock, or the finer grained stones which are hardened
mud, we find in them the remains of shells, sometimes
of bones, and also of plant leaves and stems, which in
their time had formed the flotsam of a shore. Indeed,
one may say that nearly every rock which has not been
formed in ancient volcanoes, or been altered by their
heat, carries in it <i>some</i> trace of plant or animal. These
remains are often very fragmentary and difficult to recognize,
but sometimes they are wellnigh as perfect as
dried specimens of living things. When they are recognizable
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
as plant or animal remains they are commonly
called &ldquo;fossils&rdquo;, and it is from their testimony that we
must learn all we can know about the life of the past.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/fig1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="349" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;The Face of a Quarry, showing layers or &ldquo;beds&rdquo; of different rock, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>.
The top gravel and soil <i>s</i> has been disintegrated by the growing plants and atmosphere.</p>
<p>If we would find such stones for ourselves, the
quarries offer the best hunting ground, for there several
layers of rock are exposed, and we can reach fresh surfaces
which have not been decayed by rain and storm.
<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> shows a diagram of a quarry, and illustrates the
almost universal fact that the beds of rock when undisturbed
lie parallel to each other. Rock <i>a</i> in the figure
is fine-grained limestone, <i>b</i> black friable shale mixed
with sand, and <i>c</i> purer shale. In such a series of rocks
the best fossils will be found in the limestone; its harder
and finer structure acting as a better preservative of
organisms than the others. In limestone one finds both
plant and animal fossils, very often mixed together as
the flotsam on the shore is mixed. Many limestones
split along parallel planes, and may break into quite
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
thin sheets on whose surfaces the flattened fossils show
particularly well.</p>
<p>It is, however, with the plant fossils that we must
concern ourselves, and among them we find great variety
of form. Some are more or less complete, and give an
immediate idea of the size and appearance of the plant
to which they had belonged; but such are rare. One of
the best-known examples of this type is the base of a
great tree trunk illustrated in the <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>. With
such a fossil there is no shadow of doubt that it is part
of a giant tree, and its spreading roots running so far
horizontally along the ground suggest the picture of a
large crown of branches. Most fossils, however, are
much less illuminating, and it is usually only by the
careful piecing together of fragments that we can obtain
a mental picture of a fossil plant.</p>
<p>A fossil such as that illustrated in the frontispiece&mdash;and
on a smaller scale this type of preservation is one
of the commonest&mdash;does not actually consist of the plant
body itself. Although from the outside it looks as though
it were a stem base covered with bark, the whole of the
inner portion is composed of fine hard rock with no
trace of woody tissue. In such specimens we have the
shape, size, and form of the plant preserved, but none of
its actual structure or cells. It is, in fact, a <span class="sc">Cast</span>. Fossil
casts appear to have been formed by fine sand or mud
silting round a submerged stump and enclosing it as
completely as if it had been set in plaster of Paris; then
the wood and soft tissue decayed and the hollow was
filled up with more fine silt; gradually all the bark also
decayed and the mud hardened into stone. Thus the
stone mould round the outside of the plant enclosed a
stone casting. When, after lying for ages undisturbed,
these fossils are unearthed, they are so hard and &ldquo;set&rdquo;
that the surrounding stone peels away from the inner
part, just as a plaster cast comes away from an object
and retains its shape. There are many varieties
of casts among fossil plants. Sometimes on breaking
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
a rock it will split so as to show the perfect form
of the surface of a stem, while its reverse is left on
the stone as is shown in <a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>. Had we only the
reverse we should still have been able to see the form
of the leaf bases by taking a wax impression from it;
although there is nothing of the actual tissue of the
plant in such a fossil. Sometimes casts of leaf bases
show the detail preserved with wonderful sharpness, as
in <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>. This is an illustration of the leaf scars of
<i>Lepidodendron</i>, which often form particularly good casts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="351" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 2.&mdash;<span class="small">A</span>, Cast of the Surface showing the Shape of Leaf Bases of <i>Sigillaria</i>; <span class="small">B</span>, the
reverse of the impression left on the adjacent layer of rock. (Photo.)</p>
<p>In other instances the cast may simply represent the
internal hollows of the plant. This happens most commonly
in the case of stems which contained soft pith
cells which quickly decayed, or with naturally hollow
stems like the Horse-tails (<i>Equisetum</i>) of to-day. Fine
mud or sand silted into such hollows completely filling
them up, and then, whether the rest of the plant
were preserved or not, the shape of the inside of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
stem remains as a solid stone. Where this has happened,
and the outer part of the plant
has decayed so as to leave no trace,
the solid plug of stone from the centre
may look very much like an actual stem
itself, as it is cylindrical and may have
surface markings like those on the outsides
of stems. Some of the casts of
this type were for long a puzzle to the
older fossil botanists, particularly that
illustrated in <a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>, where the whole
looks like a pile of discs.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sternbergia.</i>&rdquo;
Internal cast of the stem of <i>Cordaites</i>.</p>
<p>The true nature of this fossil was recognized when casts of the plan
were found with some of the wood preserved outside the castings; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
it was then known that the plant had a hollow pith,
with transverse bands of tissue across it at intervals
which caused the curious constrictions in the cast.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 5.&mdash;Leaf Impressions of &ldquo;Fern&rdquo; <i>Sphenopteris</i> on Shale. (Photo.)</p>
<p>Another form of cast which is common in some
rocks is that of seeds. As a rule these casts are not
connected with any actually preserved tissue, but they
show the external form, or the form of the stony part
of the seed. Well-known seeds of this type are those
of <i>Trigonocarpon</i>, which has three characteristic ridges
down the stone. Sometimes in the fine sandstone in
which they occur embedded, the <i>internal</i> cast lies embedded
<i>in the external</i> cast, and between them there
is a slight space, now empty, but which once contained
the actual shell of the seed, now decayed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Thus we may rattle the &ldquo;stone&rdquo; of a fossil fruit as
we do the dried nuts of to-day&mdash;the external resemblance
between the living and the fossil is very
striking, but of the actual tissues of the fossil seed
nothing is left.</p>
<p>Casts have been of great service to the fossil
botanists, for they often give clear indications of the
external appearance of the parts they represent; particularly
of stems, leaf scars, and large seeds. But all
such fossils are very imperfect records of the past
plants, for none of the actual plant tissues, no minute
anatomy or cell structure, is preserved in that way.</p>
<p>A type of fossil which often shows more detail, and
which usually retains something of the actual tissues of
the plant, is that known technically as the <span class="sc">Impression</span>.
These fossils are the most attractive of all the many
kinds we have scattered through the rocks, for they
often show with marvellous perfection the most delicate
and beautiful fern leaves, such as in <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>. Here the
plant shows up as a black silhouette against the grey
stone, and the very veins of the midrib and leaves are
quite visible.</p>
<p><a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a> shows another fernlike leaf in an impression,
not quite flat like that shown in <a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>, but with a
slight natural curvature of the leaves similar to what
would have been their form in life. Though an impression,
this specimen is not of the &ldquo;pressed plant&rdquo;
type, it almost might be described as a <i>bas-relief</i>.</p>
<p>Sometimes impressions of fern foliage are very large,
and show highly branched and complex leaves like those
of tree ferns, and they may cover large sheets of stone.
They are particularly common in the fine shales above
coal seams, and are best seen in the mines, for they
are often too big to bring to the surface complete.</p>
<p>In most impressions the black colour is due to a
film of carbon which represents the partly decomposed
tissues of the plant. Sometimes this film is cohesive
enough to be detached from the stone without damage.
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Beautiful specimens of this kind are to be seen in the
Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh where the coiled
bud of a young fern leaf has been separated from the
rock on which it was pressed, and mounted on glass.
Such specimens might be called mummy plants, for they
are the actual plant material, but so decayed and
withered that the internal cells are no longer intact.
In really well preserved ones it is sometimes possible
to peel off the plant film, and then treat it with strong
chemical agents to clear the black carbon atoms away,
and mount it for microscopic examination, when the
actual outline of the epidermis cells can be seen.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.&mdash;Leaf Impression of <i>Ginkgo</i>, of which
the film was strong enough to peel off complete</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>, the impression is that of a <i>Ginkgo</i> leaf, and
after treatment the cells of the epidermis were perfectly
recognizable under the microscope, with the stomates (breathing
pores) also well preserved. This is shown
in <a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>, where the outline
of the cells was drawn from the microscope. In such specimens,
however, it is only the outer skin which is preserved, the
inner soft tissue, the vital anatomy of the plant, is crushed and
carbonized.</p>
<p>Leaves, stems, roots, even flowers (in the more recent
rocks) and seeds may all be preserved as impressions;
and very often those from the more recently formed
rocks are so sharply defined
and perfect that they seem
to be actual dried leaves laid
on the stone.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>c</i>, Ordinary cells; <i>s</i>, stomates; <i>v</i>, elongated cells above the vein.</p>
<p>Much evidence has been
accumulated that goes to
show that the rocks which
contain the best impressions
were originally deposited
under tranquil conditions in
water. It might have been
in a pool or quiet lake
with overshadowing trees, or
a landlocked inlet of the
sea where silt quietly accumulated, and as the plant
fragments fell or drifted into the spot they were
covered by fine-grained mud without disturbance. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the case of those which are very well preserved this
must have taken place with considerable rapidity, so
that they were shut away from contact with the air and
from the decay which it induces.</p>
<p>Impressions in the thin sheets of fine rock may be
compared to dried specimens pressed between sheets
of blotting paper; they are flattened, preserved from
decay, and their detailed outline is retained. Fossils
of this kind are most valuable, for they give a clear
picture of the form of the foliage, and when, as sometimes
happens, large masses of leaves, or branches
with several leaves attached to them, are preserved
together, it is possible to reconstruct the plant from
them. It is chiefly from such impressions that the inspiration
is drawn for those semi-imaginary pictures of
the forests of long ago. From them also are drawn
many facts of prime importance to scientists about the
nature and appearance of plants, of which the internal
anatomy is known from other specimens, and also about
the connection of various parts with each other.</p>
<p>Sometimes isolated impressions are found in clay
balls or nodules. When the latter are split open they
may show as a centre or nucleus a leaf or cone, round
which the nodule has collected. In such cases the
plant is often preserved without compression, and may
show something of the minute details of organization.
The preservation, however, is generally far from perfect
when viewed from a microscopical standpoint. <a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>
shows one of these smooth, clayey nodules split open,
and within it the cone which formed its centre, also
split into two, and standing in high relief, with its
scales showing clearly. Similar nodules or balls of
clay are found to-day, forming in slowly running water,
and it may be generally observed that they collect
round some rubbish, shell, or plant fragment. These
nodules are particularly well seen nowadays in the
mouth of the Clyde, where they are formed with great
rapidity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.&mdash;Clay Nodule split open, showing the two halves of the cone which was its
centre. (Photo.)</p>
<p>Another kind of preservation is that which coats
over the whole plant surface with mineral matter, which
hardens, and thus preserves the <i>form</i> of the plant.
This process can be observed going on to-day in the
neighbourhood of hot volcanic streams where the water
is heavily charged with minerals. In most cases such
fossils have proved of little importance to science,
though there are some interesting specimens in the
French museums which have not yet been fully examined.
A noteworthy fossil of this type is the <i>Chara</i>,
which, growing in masses together, has sometimes been
preserved in this way in large quantities, indicating the
existence of an ancient pond in the locality.</p>
<p>There is quite a variety of other types of preservation
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
among fossil plants, but they are of minor interest
and importance, and hardly justify detailed consideration.
One example that should be mentioned is Amber.
This is the gum of old resinous trees, and is a well-known
substance which may rank as a &ldquo;fossil&rdquo;. Jet,
too, is formed from plants, while coal is so important
that the whole of the next chapter will be devoted to
its consideration. Even the black lead of pencils possibly
represents plants that were once alive on this
globe.</p>
<p>Though such remains tell us of the existence of
plants at the place they were found at a known
period in the past, yet they tell very little about the
actual structure of the plants themselves, and therefore
very little that is of real use to the botanist. Fortunately,
however, there are fossils which preserve every
cell of the plant tissues, each one perfect, distended
as in life, and yet replaced by stone so as to be hard
and to allow of the preparation of thin sections which
can be studied with the microscope. These are the
vegetable fossils which are of prime importance to the
botanist and the scientific enquirer into the evolution
of plants. Such specimens are commonly known as
<span class="sc">Petrifactions</span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes small isolated stumps of wood or branches
have been completely permeated by silica, which replaces
the cell walls and completely preserves and hardens the
tissues. This silicified wood is found in a number of
different beds of rock, and may be seen washed out on
the shore in Yorkshire, Sutherland, and other places
where such rocks occur. When such a block is cut and
polished the annual rings and all the fine structure or
&ldquo;grain&rdquo; of the wood become as apparent as in recent
wood. From these fossils, too, microscopic sections can
be cut, and then the individual wood cells can be studied
almost as well as those of living trees. A particularly
notable example of fossil tree trunks is the Tertiary
forest of the Yellowstone Park. Here the petrified
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
trunks are weathered out and stand together much as
they must have stood when alive; they are of course
bereft of their foliage branches.</p>
<p>Such specimens, however, are usually only isolated
blocks of wood, often fragments from large stumps
which show nothing but the rings of late-formed wood.
It is impossible to connect them with the impressions
of leaves or fruits in most cases, so that of the plants
they represent we know only the anatomical structure
of the secondary wood and nothing of the foliage or
general appearance of the plant as a whole. Hence
these specimens also give a very partial representation
of the plants to which they belonged.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, there is still another type of
preservation of fossils, a type more perfect than any
of the others and sometimes combining the advantages
of all of them. This is the special type of petrifaction
which includes, not a single piece of wood, but a whole
mass of vegetation consisting of fragments of stems,
roots, leaves, and even seeds, sometimes all together.
These petrifactions are those of masses of forest d&eacute;bris
which were lying as they dropped from the trees, or had
drifted together as such fragments do. The plant tissues
in such masses are preserved so that the most delicate
soft tissue cells are perfect, and in many cases the
sections are so distinct that one might well be deluded
into the belief that it is a living plant at which one
looks.</p>
<p>Very important and well-known specimens have been
found in France and described by the French pal&aelig;obotanists.
As a rule these specimens are preserved in
silica, and are found now in irregular masses of the
nature of chert. Of still greater importance, however,
owing partly to their greater abundance and partly to
the quantity of scientific work that has been done on
them, are the masses of stone found in the English coal
seams and commonly called &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; are best known from Lancashire
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and Yorkshire, where they are extremely common in
some of the mines, but they also occur in Westphalia
and other places on the Continent.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>a a</i>, In surface view; <i>b b</i>, cut across. All washed with acid to make the coal balls
show up against the black coal. (Photo by Lomax.)</p>
<p>In external appearance the &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; are slightly
irregular roundish masses, most generally about the size
of potatoes, and black on the outside from films of
adhering coal. Their size varies greatly, and they have
been found from that of peas up to masses with a
diameter of a foot and a half. They lie embedded in
the coal and are not very easily recognizable in it at
first, because they are black also, but when washed
with acid they turn greyish-white and then can be
recognized clearly. <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a> shows a block of coal with
an exceptionally large number of the &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; embedded
in it. This figure illustrates their slightly
irregular rounded form in a typical manner. By
chemical analysis they are found to consist of a nearly
pure mixture of the carbonates of lime and magnesia;
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
though in some specimens there is a considerable
quantity of iron sulphide, and in all there is at least
5 per cent of various impurities and some quantity of
carbon.</p>
<p>The important mineral compounds, CaCO<sub>3</sub> and
MgCO<sub>3</sub>, are mixed in very different quantities, and even
in coal balls lying quite close to each other there is
often much dissimilarity in this respect. In whatever
proportion these minerals are combined, it seems to
make but little difference to their preservative power,
and in good &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; they may completely replace
and petrify each individual cell of the plants in them.</p>

<p>The particular value of the coal balls as records of
past vegetation lies in the fact that they are petrifactions,
not of individual plants alone, but of masses
of plant d&eacute;bris. Hence in one of these stony concretions
may lie twigs with leaves attached, bits of stems
with their fruits, and fine rootlets growing through the
mass. A careful study and comparison of these fragments
has led to the connection, piece by piece, of the
various parts of many plants. Such a specimen as that
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
figured in <a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a> shows how the soft tissues of young
leaves are preserved, and how their relation to each
other and to the axis is indicated.</p>
<p>Hitherto the only concretions of the nature of &ldquo;coal
balls&rdquo; containing well preserved plant d&eacute;bris, have been
found in the coal or immediately above it, and are of
Pal&aelig;ozoic age (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>). Recent exploration, however,
has resulted in the discovery of similar concretions of
Mesozoic age, from which much may be hoped in the
future. Still, at present, it is to the pal&aelig;ozoic specimens
we must turn for nearly all valuable knowledge about
ancient plants, and primarily to that form of preservation
of the specimens known as structural petrifactions, of
which the &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; are both the commonest and the
most perfect examples.</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">COAL, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF PLANT REMAINS</span></h2>
<p>Some of the many forms which are taken by fossil
plants were shortly described in the last chapter, but
the most important of all, namely coal, must now be
considered. Of the fossils hitherto mentioned many are
difficult to recognize without examining them very
closely, and one might say that all have but little
influence on human life, for they are of little practical
or commercial use, and their scientific value is not yet
very widely known. Of all fossil plants, the great exception
is coal. Its commercial importance all over the
world needs no illustration, and its appearance needs no
description for it is in use in nearly every household.
Quite apart from its economic importance, coal has a
unique place among fossils in the eyes of the scientist,
and is of special interest to the pal&aelig;ontologist.</p>
<p>In England nearly all the coal lies in rocks of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
great age, belonging to a period very remote in the
world&rsquo;s history. The rocks bearing the coal contain
other fossils, principally those of marine animals,
which are characteristic of them and of the period
during which they were formed, which is generally
known as the &ldquo;Coal Measure period&rdquo;. There is
geological proof that at one time the coal seams
were much more widely spread over England than
they are at present; they have been broken up
and destroyed in the course of ages, by the natural
movements among the rocks and by the many changes
and processes of disintegration and decay which have
gone on ever since they were deposited. To-day there
are but relatively small coal-bearing areas, which have
been preserved in the hollows of the synclines.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The seams of coal are extremely numerous, and
even the same seam may vary greatly in thickness.
From a quarter of an inch to five or six feet is the
commonest thickness for coal in this country, but there
are many beds abroad of very much greater size. Thin
seams often lie irregularly in coarse sandstone; for example,
they may be commonly seen in the Millstone
Grit; but typical coal seams are found embedded between
rocks of a more or less definite character known
as the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; and &ldquo;floor&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="547" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.&mdash;Diagram of a Series of Parallel Coal Seams with
Underclays and Shale Roofs of varying thicknesses</p>
<p>Basalts, granites, and such rocks do not contain coal;
the coal measures in which the seams of coal occur are,
generally speaking, limestones, fine sandstones, and
shales, that is to say, rocks which in their origin were
deposited under water. In detail almost every seam
has some individual peculiarity, but the following represents
two types of typical seams. In many cases, below
the coal, the limestone or sandstone rocks give place to
fine, yellow-coloured layers of clay, which varies from a
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
few inches to many feet in thickness and is called the
&ldquo;underclay&rdquo;. This fine clay is generally free from
pebbles and coarse d&eacute;bris of all kinds, and is often
supposed to be the soil in which the plants forming the
coal had been growing. The line of demarcation between
the coal and the clay is usually very sharp, and
the compact black layers of hard coal stop almost as
abruptly on the upper side and give place to a shale or
limestone &ldquo;roof&rdquo;; see <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>, layers 5, 6, and 7. Very
frequently a number of small seams come together,
lying parallel, and sometimes succeeding each other so
rapidly that the &ldquo;roof&rdquo; is eliminated, and a clay floor
followed by a coal seam, is succeeded immediately by
another clay floor and another coal seam, as in <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>,
layers 10, 11, and 12. The relative thickness of these
beds also varies very greatly, and over an underclay of
seven or eight feet the coal seam may only reach a
couple of inches, while a thick seam may have a floor
of very slight dimensions. These relations depend on
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
such a variety of local circumstances from the day they
were forming, that it is only possible to unravel the
causes when an individual case is closely studied. The
main sequence, however, is constant and is that illustrated
in <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>.</p>
<p>The second type of seam is that in which the underclay
floor is not present, and is replaced either by shales
or by a special very hard rock of a finely granular nature
called &ldquo;gannister&rdquo;. In the gannister floor it is usual
to find traces of rootlets and basal stumps of plants,
which seem to indicate that the gannister was the
ground in which the plants forming the coal were
rooted. The coal itself is generally very pure plant
remains, though between its layers are often found
bands of shaly stone which are called &ldquo;dirt bands&rdquo;.
These are particularly noticeable in thick seams, and
they may be looked on as corresponding to the roof
shales; as though, in fact, the roof had started to form
but had only reached a slight development when the
coal formation began again.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="267" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.&mdash;Diagram of Coal Seam with Gannister Floor, in which are
traces of rootlets <i>r</i>, and of stumps of root-like organs <i>s</i></p>
<p>That the coal is strikingly different from the rocks in
which it lies is very obvious, but that alone is no indication
of its origin. It is now so universally known and
accepted that coal is the remains of vegetables that no
proofs are usually offered for the statement. It is, however,
of both interest and importance to marshal the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
evidence for this belief. The grounds for recognizing
coal as consisting of practically pure plant remains are
many and various, so that only the more important of
them will be considered now. The most direct suggestion
lies in the impressions of leaves and stems which
are found between its layers; this, however, is confronted
by the parallel case of plant impressions found
in shales and limestones which are not of vegetable
origin, so that it might be argued that those plants in
the coal drifted in as did those in the limestone. But
when we examine the black impressions on limestone
or sandstone, an item of value is noticeable; it is often
possible to peel off a film, lying between the upper and
lower impression, of black coaly substance, sometimes an
eighth of an inch thick, and hard and shining like coal.
This follows the outline of the plant form of the impression,
and it is certain that this minute &ldquo;coal seam&rdquo; was
formed from the plant tissues. It is, in fact, a coal seam
bearing the clearest possible evidence of its plant nature.
We have only to imagine this multiplied by many plants
lying tightly packed together, with no mineral impurities
between, to see that it would yield a coal seam like those
we find actually existing.</p>
<p>In some cases in the coal itself a certain amount of
the structure of the plants which formed it remains,
though usually, in the process of their decay the tissues
have entirely decomposed, and left only their carbonized
elements. Chemical analysis reveals that, beyond the
percentage of mineral ash which is found in living plants,
there is little in a pure sample of coal that is not carbonaceous.
All the deposits of carbon found in any
form in nature can be traced to some animal or vegetable
remains, so that it is logical to assume that coal
also arose from either animal or plant d&eacute;bris. But were
coal of an animal origin, the amount of mineral matter
in it would be much larger as well as being of a different
nature; for almost all animals have skeletons, even the
simplest single-celled protozoa often own calcareous
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
shells, sponges have siliceous spicules, molluscs hard
shells, and the higher animals bones and teeth. These
things are of a very permanent nature, and would certainly
be found in quantities in the coal had animals
formed it. Further, the peat of to-day, which collects
in thick compact masses of vegetable, shows how plants
may form a material consisting of carbonized remains.
By certain experiments in which peat was subjected to
pressure and heat, practically normal coal was made
from it.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 16.&mdash;Mass of Coal with Coal Balls, <span class="small">A</span> and <span class="small">B</span> both enclosing part of the same stem <span class="small">L</span></p>
<p>Still a further witness may be found in the structure
of the &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; described in the last chapter. These
stony masses, lying in the pure coal, might well be considered
as apart from it and bearing no relation to its
structure; but recent work has shown that they were
actually formed at the same time as the coal, developing
in its mass as mineral concretions round some of the
plants in the soft, saturated, peaty mass which was to be
hardened into coal later on.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
All &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; do not
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
show their concretionary structure so clearly, but sometimes
it can be seen that they are made with concentric
bands or markings like those characteristic of ordinary
mineral concretions (see <a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). Concretions are formed
by the crystallization of minerals round some centre, and
it must have happened that in the coal seams in which
the coal-ball concretions are found that this process took
place in the soft plant mass before it hardened. Recent
research has found that there is good evidence that those
seams<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
resulted from the slow accumulation of plant
d&eacute;bris under the salt or brackish water in whose swamps
the plants were growing, and that as they were collecting
the ground slowly sank till they were quite below
the level of the sea and were covered by marine silt.
At the same time some of the minerals present in the
sea water, which must have saturated the mass, crystallized
partly and deposited themselves round centres in
the plant tissues, and by enclosing them and penetrating
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
them preserved them from decay till the mineral structure
entirely replaced the cells, molecule by molecule.
Evidence is not wanting that this process went on without
disturbance, for in <a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a> is shown a mass of coal
in which lie several coal balls, two of which enclose
parts of the same plant. This means that round different
centres in the same stem two of the concretions
were forming and preserving the tissues; the two stone
masses, however, did not enlarge enough to unite, but
left a part of the tissue unmineralized, which is now
seen as a streak of coal. We have here the most important
proof that the coal balls are actually formed in
the coal and of the plants making the coal, for had those
coal balls come in as pebbles, or in any way from the
outside into the coal, they could not have remained in
such a position as to lie side by side enclosing part of
the same stem. There are many other details which
may be used in this proof, but this one illustration serves
to show the importance of coal balls when dealing with
the theories of the origin of coal, for they are perfectly
preserved samples of what the whole coal mass was at
one time.</p>
<p>There are but few seams, however, which contain
coal balls, and about those in which they do not occur
our knowledge is very scanty. It is often assumed that
the plant impressions in the shales above the coal seams
can be taken as fair samples of those which formed the
coal itself; but this has been recently shown to be a
fallacious argument in some cases, so that it is impossible
to rely on it in general. The truth is, that though coal
is one of the most studied of all the geological deposits,
we are still profoundly ignorant of the details of its formation
except in a few cases.</p>
<p>The way in which coal seams were formed has been
described often and variously, and for many years there
were heated discussions between the upholders of the
different views as to the merits of their various theories.
It is now certain that there must have been at least four
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
principal ways in which coal was formed, and the different
seams are illustrations of the products of different
methods. In all cases more or less water is required,
for coal is what is known as a sedimentary deposit, that
is, one which collects under water, like the fine mud and
silt and d&eacute;bris in a lake. It will be understood, however,
that if the plant remains were collecting at any spot, and
the water brought in sand and mud as well, then the
deposit could not have resulted in pure coal, but would
have been a sandy mixture with many plant remains,
and would have resulted in the formation of a rock, such
as parts of the millstone grit, where there are many
streaks of coal through the stone.</p>
<p>Among various coal seams, evidence for the following
modes of coal formation can be found:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>In fresh water.</i>&mdash;In still freshwater lakes or
pools, with overhanging plants growing on the banks,
twigs and leaves which fell or were blown into the
water became waterlogged and sank to the bottom.
With a luxuriant growth of plants rapidly collecting
under water, and there preserved from contact with the
air and its decaying influence, enough plant remains
would collect to form a seam. After that some change
in the local conditions took place, and other deposits
covered the plants and began the accumulations which
finally pressed the vegetable mass into coal.</p>
<p>To freshwater lakes of large size plants might also
have been brought by rivers and streams; they would
have become waterlogged in time, after floating farther
than the sand and stones with which they came, and
would thus settle and form a deposit practically free
from anything but plant remains.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>As peat.</i>&mdash;Peat commonly forms on our heather
moors and bogs to-day to a considerable thickness. This
also took place long ago in all probability, and when the
level of the land altered it would have been covered by
other deposits, pressed, and finally changed into coal.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>In salt or brackish water, growing in situ.</i>&mdash;Trees
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and undergrowth growing thickly together in a salt or
brackish marsh supplied a large quantity of d&eacute;bris which
fell into the mud or water below them, and were thus
shut off from the air and partly preserved. When conditions
favoured the formation of a coal seam the land
level was slowly sinking, and so, though the d&eacute;bris collected
in large quantities, it was always kept just beneath
the water level. Finally the land sank more rapidly, till the
vegetable mass was quite under sea water, then mud was
deposited over it, and the materials which were afterwards
hardened to form the roof rocks were deposited.
This was the case in those seams in which &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo;
occur, and the evidence of the sea water covering the
coal soon after it was deposited lies in the numerous sea
shells found in the roof immediately above it.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>In salt water, drifted material.</i>&mdash;Tree trunks
and large tangled masses of vegetation drifted out to
sea by the rivers just as they do to-day. These became
waterlogged, and finally sank some distance from the
shore. (Those sinking near the shore would not form
pure coal, for sand and mud would be mixed with them,
also brought down by rivers and stirred up from the
bottom by waves.) The currents would bring numbers
of such plants to the same area until a large mass was
deposited on the sea floor. Finally the local conditions
would have changed, the currents then bringing mud or
sand, which covered the vegetable mass and formed the
mineral roof of the resulting coal seam. There is a
variety of what might be called the &ldquo;drifted coals&rdquo;,
which appears to have been formed of nothing but the
<i>spores</i> of plants of a resinous nature. These structures
must have been very light, and possibly floated a long
distance before sinking.</p>
<p>If we could but obtain enough evidence to understand
each case fully we should probably find that every
coal seam represents some slightly different mode of
formation, that in each case there was some local peculiarity
in the plants themselves and the way they accumulated
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
in coal-forming masses, but the above four methods
will be found to cover the principal ways in which coal
has arisen.</p>
<p>Coal, as we now know it, has a great variety of
qualities. The differences probably depend only to a
small extent on the varieties among the plants forming
it, and are almost entirely due to the many later conditions
which have affected the coal after its original
formation. Some such conditions are the various upheavals
and depressions to which the rocks containing
the coal have been subjected, the weight of the beds
lying over the coal seams, and the high temperatures to
which they may have been subjected when lying under
a considerable depth of later-deposited rocks. The influence
on the coal of these and many other physical factors
has been enormous, but they are purely cosmical and
belong to the special realm of geological study, and so
cannot be considered in detail now.</p>
<p>To return to our special subject, namely, the plants
themselves which are now preserved in the coal. Their
nature and appearance, their affinities and minute structure,
can only be ascertained by a detailed study, to
which the following chapters will be devoted, though
in their limited space but an outline sketch of the subject
can be drawn.</p>
<p>It has been stated by some writers that in the Coal
Measure period plants were more numerous and luxuriant
than they ever were before or ever have been since.
This view could only have been brought forward by one
who was considering the geology of England alone, and
in any case there appears to be very little real evidence
for such a view. Certainly in Europe a large proportion
of the coal is of this age, and to supply the enormous
masses of vegetation it represents a great growth of
plants must have existed. But it is evident that just
at the Carboniferous period in what is now called Europe
the physical conditions of the land which roughly corresponded
to the present Continent were such as favoured
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the accumulation of plants, and the gradual sinking of
the land level also favoured their preservation under
rapidly succeeding deposits. Of the countless plants
growing in Europe to-day very few stand any chance
of being preserved as coal for the future; so that, unless
the physical conditions were suitable, plants might have
been growing in great quantity at any given period without
ever forming coal. But now that the geology of the
whole world is becoming better known, it is found that
coal is by no means specially confined to the Coal Measure
age. Even in Europe coals of a much later date are worked,
while abroad, especially in Asia and Australia, the later
coals are very important. For example, in Japan, seams
of coal 14, 20, and even more feet in thickness are worked
which belong to the Tertiary period (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), while in
Manchuria coal 100 feet thick is reported of the same age.
When these facts are considered it is soon found that all
the statements made about the unique vegetative luxuriance
of the Coal Measure period are founded either on
insufficient evidence or on no evidence at all.</p>
<p>The plants forming the later coals must have had in
their own structure much that differed from those forming
the old coals of Britain, and the gradual change in
the character of the vegetation in the course of the succeeding
ages is a point of first-rate importance and
interest which will be considered shortly in the next
chapter.</p>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE SEVEN AGES OF PLANT LIFE</span></h2>
<p>Life has played its important part on the earth for
countless series of years, of the length of whose periods
no one has any exact knowledge. Many guesses have
been made, and many scientific theories have been used
to estimate their duration, but they remain inscrutable.
When numbers are immense they cease to hold any
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
meaning for us, for the human mind cannot comprehend
the significance of vast numbers, of immense space,
or of &aelig;ons of time. Hence when we look back on
the history of the world we cannot attempt to give
even approximate dates for its events, and the best we
can do is to speak only of great periods as units whose
relative position and whose relative duration we can
estimate to some extent.</p>
<p>Those who have studied geology, which is the
science of the world&rsquo;s history since its beginning, have
given names to the great epochs and to their chief subdivisions.
With the smaller periods and the subdivisions
of the greater ones we will not concern ourselves, for our
study of the plants it will suffice if we recognize the main
sequence of past time.</p>
<p>The main divisions are practically universal, and
evidence of their existence and of the character of the
creatures living in them can be found all over the
world; the smaller divisions, however, may often be
local, or only of value in one continent. To the specialist
even the smallest of them is of importance, and
is a link in the chain of evidence with which he cannot
dispense; but we are at present concerned only with
the broad outlines of the history of the plants of these
periods, so will not trouble ourselves with unnecessary
details.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
Corresponding to certain marked changes in
the character of the vegetation, we find seven important
divisions of geological time which we will take as
our unit periods, and which are tabulated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Cainozoic</p>
<p class="t3">I. Present Day.</p>
<p class="t3">II. Tertiary.</p>
<p class="t0">Mesozoic</p>
<p class="t3">III. Upper Cretaceous (or Chalk).</p>
<p class="t3">IV. The rest of the Mesozoic.</p>
<p class="t3">V. Newer Pal&aelig;ozoic, including</p>
<p class="t6">Permian.</p>
<p class="t6">Carboniferous.</p>
<p class="t6">Devonian.</p>
<p class="t0">Pal&aelig;ozoic</p>
<p class="t3">VI. Older Pal&aelig;ozoic.</p>
<p class="t0">Eozoic</p>
<p class="t3">VII. Arch&aelig;an.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Now the actual length of these various periods was
very different. The epoch of the Present Day is only
in its commencement, and is like a thin line if compared
with the broad bands of the past epochs. By far the
greatest of the periods is the Arch&aelig;an, and even the
Older Pal&aelig;ozoic is probably longer than all the others
taken together. It is, however, so remote, and the rocks
which were formed in it retain so little plant structure
that is decipherable, so few specimens which are more
than mere fragments, that we know very little about it
from the point of view of the plant life of the time.
It includes the immense indefinite epochs when plants
began to evolve, and the later ones when animals of
many kinds flourished, and when plants, too, were of
great size and importance, though we are ignorant of
their structure. Of all the seven divisions of time, we
can say least about the two earliest, simply for want of
anything to say which is founded on fact rather than on
theoretical conclusions.</p>
<p>Although these periods seem clearly marked off from
one another when looked at from a great distance, they
are, of course, but arbitrary divisions of one long, continuous
series of slow changes. It is not in the way of
nature to make an abrupt change and suddenly shut off
one period&mdash;be it a day or an &aelig;on&mdash;from another, and
just as the seasons glide almost imperceptibly into one
another, so did the great periods of the past. Thus,
though there is a strong and very evident contrast between
the plants typical of the Carboniferous period
and of the Mesozoic, those of the Permian are to some
extent intermediate, and between the beginning of the
Permian and the end of the Carboniferous&mdash;if judged by
the flora&mdash;it is often hard to decide.</p>
<p>It must be realized that almost any given spot of
land&mdash;the north of England, for example&mdash;has been
beneath the sea, and again elevated into the air, at
least more than once. That the hard rocks which make
its present-day hills have been built up from the silt
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and d&eacute;bris under an ocean, and after being formed have
seen daylight on a land surface long ago, and sunk again
to be covered by newer deposits, perhaps even a second
or a third time, before they rose for the time that is the
present. Yet all these profound changes took place so
slowly that had we been living then we could have felt
no motion, just as we feel no motion to-day, though the
land is continuing to change all around us. The great
alternations between land and water over large areas
mark out to some extent the main periods tabulated on
<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>, for after each great submersion the rising land
seems to have harboured plants and animals with somewhat
different characters from those which inhabited it
before. Similarly, when the next submersion laid down
more rocks of limestone and sandstone, they enclosed the
shells of some creatures different from those which had
inhabited the seas of the region previously.</p>
<p>Through all the periods the actual rocks formed
are very similar&mdash;shales, limestones, sandstones, clays.
When any rocks happen to have preserved neither
plant nor animal remains it is almost impossible to tell
to which epoch they belong, except from a comparative
study of their position as regards other rocks which do
retain fossils. This depends on the fact that the physical
processes of rock building have gone on throughout
the history of the globe on very much the same lines
as they are following at present. By the sifting power
of water, fine mud, sand, pebbles, and other d&eacute;bris are
separated from each other and collected in masses like
to like. The fine mud will harden into shales, sandgrains
massed together harden into sandstones, and so
on, and when, after being raised once more to form dry
land, they are broken up by wind and rain and brought
down again to the sea, they settle out once again in a
similar way and form new shales and sandstones; and so
on indefinitely. But meantime the living things, both
plant and animal, have been changing, growing, evolving,
and the leafy twig brought down with the sandgrains
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
in the flooded river of one epoch differs from
that brought down by the river of a succeeding
epoch&mdash;though it might chance that the sandgrains
were the same identical ones. And hence it is by the
remains of the plants and animals in a rock that we
can tell to which epoch it belonged. Unless, of course,
ready-formed fossils from an earlier epoch get mixed
with it, coming as pebbles in the river in flood&mdash;but
that is a subtle point of geological importance which
we cannot consider here. Such cases are almost always
recognizable, and do not affect the main proposition.</p>
<p>From the various epochs, the plants which have been
preserved as fossils are in nearly all cases those which
had lived on the land, or at least on swamps and marshes
by the land. Of water plants in the wide sense, including
both those growing in fresh water and those
in the sea, we have comparatively few. This lack is
particularly remarkable in the case of the seaweeds, because
they were actually growing in the very medium
in which the bulk of the rocks were formed, and which
we know from recent experiments acts as a preservative
for the tissues of land plants submerged in it. It must
be remembered, however, that almost all the plants
growing in water have very soft tissues, and are usually
of small size and delicate structure as compared with
land plants, and thus would stand less chance of being
preserved, and would also stand less chance of being
recognized to-day were they preserved. The mark on
a stone of the impression of a soft film of a waterweed
would be very slight as compared with that left by a
leathery leaf or the woody twig of a land plant.</p>
<p>There are, of course, exceptions, and, as will be
noted later on (see <a href="#c17">Chapter XVII</a>), there are fossil seaweeds
and fossil freshwater plants, but we may take it
on the whole that the fossils we shall have to deal with
and that give important evidence, are those of the land
which had drifted out to sea, in the many cases when
they are found in rocks together with sea shells.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Let us now consider very shortly the salient features
of the seven epochs we have named as the chief divisions
of time. The vegetation of the <span class="sc">Carboniferous Period</span>
is better known to us than that of any other period except
that of the present day, so that it will form the best
starting-point for our consideration.</p>
<p>At this period there were, as there are to-day, oceans
and continents, high lands, low lands, rivers and lakes,
in fact, all the physical features of the present-day world,
but they were all in different places from those of to-day.
If we confine our attention to Britain, we find that at
that period the far north, Scotland, Wales, and Charnwood
were higher land, but the bulk of the southern
area was covered by flat swamps or shallow inlets, where
the land level gradually changed, slowly sinking in one
place and slowly rising in others, which later began
also to sink. Growing on this area wherever they could
get a foothold were many plants, all different from any
now living. Among them none bore flowers. A few
families bore seeds in a peculiar way, differing widely
from most seed-bearing plants of to-day. The most
prevalent type of tree was that of which a stump is represented
in the <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>, and of which there were
many different species. These plants, though in size
and some other ways similar to the great trees of to-day,
were fundamentally different from them, and belonged
to a very primitive family, of which but few and small
representatives now exist, namely the Lycopods. Many
other great trees were like hugely magnified &ldquo;horsetails&rdquo;
or Equisetums; and there were also seed-bearing
Gymnosperms of a type now extinct. There were ferns
of many kinds, of which the principal ones belong to
quite extinct families, as well as several other plants
which have no parallel among living ones. Hence one
may judge that the vegetation was rich and various, and
that, as there were tall trees with seeds, the plants were
already very highly evolved. Indeed, except for the
highest group of all, the flowering plants, practically all
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the main groups now known were represented. The
flora of the Devonian was very similar in essentials.</p>
<p>If that be so, it may seem unsatisfactory to place
all the preceding &aelig;ons under one heading, the <span class="sc">Older
Pal&aelig;ozoic</span>. And, indeed, it is very unsatisfactory to
be forced to do so. We know from the study of
animal fossils that this time was vast, and that there
were several well-defined periods in it during which
many groups of animals evolved, and became extinct
after reaching their highest development; but of the
plants we know so little that we cannot make any
divisions of time which would be of real value in helping
us to understand them.</p>
<p>Fossil plants from the Early Pal&aelig;ozoic there are,
but extremely few as compared with the succeeding
period, and those few but little illuminative. In the
later divisions of the Pre-Carboniferous some of the
plants seem to belong to the same genera as those of
the Carboniferous period. There is a fern which is
characteristic of one of the earlier divisions, and there
are several rather indefinite impressions which may be
considered as seaweeds. There is evidence also that
even one of the higher groups bearing seeds (the <i>Cordaite&aelig;</i>)
was in full swing long before the Carboniferous
period began. Hence, though of Older Pal&aelig;ozoic plants
we know little of actual fact, we can surmise the salient
truths; viz., that in that period those plants must have
been evolving which were important in the Devonian
and Carboniferous periods; that in the earlier part of
that period they did not exist, and the simpler types
only clothed the earth; and that further back still, even
the simpler types had not yet evolved.</p>
<p>Names have been given to many fragmentary bits
of fossils, but for practical purposes we might as well
be without them. For the present the actual plants of
the Older Pal&aelig;ozoic must remain in a misty obscurity,
their forms we can imagine, but not know.</p>
<p>On the other hand, of the more recent periods, those
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
succeeding the Carboniferous, we have a little more
knowledge. Yet for all these periods, even the Tertiary
immediately preceding the present day, our knowledge
is far less exact and far less detailed than it is for that
unique period, the Carboniferous itself.</p>
<p>The characteristic plants of the Carboniferous period
are all very different from those of the present, and
every plant of that date is now extinct. In the succeeding
periods the main types of vegetation changed, and
with each succeeding change advanced a step towards
the stage now reached.</p>
<p>The Permian, geologically speaking, was a period
of transition. Toward the close of the Carboniferous
there were many important earth movements which
raised the level of the land and tended to enclose the
area of water in what is now Eastern Europe, and to
make a continental area with inland seas. Many of the
Carboniferous genera are found to extend through the
Permian and then die out, while at the same time others
became quite extinct as the physical conditions changed.
The seed-bearing plants became relatively more important,
and though the genus <i>Cordaites</i> died out at the
end of the period it was succeeded by an increasing
number of others of more advanced type.</p>
<p>When we come to the older <span class="sc">Mesozoic</span> rocks, we
have in England at any rate an area which was slowly
submerging again. The more important of the plants
which are preserved, and they are unfortunately all too
few, are of a type which has not yet appeared in the
earlier rocks, and are in some ways like the living
<i>Cycas</i>, though they have many characters fundamentally
different from any living type. In the vegetation of
this time, plants of Cycad-like appearance seem to have
largely predominated, and may certainly be taken as
the characteristic feature of the period. The great
Lycopod and Equisetum-like trees of the Carboniferous
are represented now only by smaller individuals of the
same groups, and practically all the genera which were
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
flourishing in the Carboniferous times have become
extinct.</p>
<p>The Cycad-like plants, however, were far more numerous
and varied in character and widely spread than they
ever were in any succeeding time. Still, no flowers
(as we understand the word to-day) had appeared, or
at least we have no indication in any fossil hitherto
discovered, that true flowers were evolved until towards
the end of the period (see, however, Chapter X).</p>
<p>The newer Mesozoic or <span class="sc">Upper Cretaceous</span> period
represents a relatively deep sea area over England, and
the rocks then formed are now known as the chalk,
which was all deposited under an ocean of some size
whose water must have been clear, and on the whole free
from ordinary d&eacute;bris, for the chalk is a remarkably homogeneous
deposit. From the point of view of plant history,
the Upper Mesozoic is notable, because in it the
flowering plants take a suddenly important position. Beds
of this age (though of very different physical nature) are
known all over the world, and in them impressions of
leaves and fruits, or their casts, are well represented.
The leaves are those of both Monocotyledons and
Dicotyledons, and the genera are usually directly comparable
with those now living, and sometimes so similar
that they appear to belong to the same genus. The
cone-bearing groups of the Gymnosperms are still
present and are represented by a number of forms, but
they are far fewer in varieties than are the groups of
flowering plants&mdash;while the Cycad-like plants, so important
in the Lower Mesozoic, have relatively few
representatives. There is, it almost seems, a sudden
jump from the flowerless type of vegetation of the
Lower Mesozoic, to a flora in the Upper Mesozoic which
is strikingly like that of the present day.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">Tertiary</span> period is a short one (geologically
speaking, and compared with those going before it), and
during it the land level rose again gradually, suffering
many great series of earth movements which built most
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of the mountain chains in Europe which are standing
to the present day. In the many plant-containing
deposits of this age, we find specimens indicating that
the flora was very similar to the plants now living, and
that flowering plants held the dominant position in the
forests, as they do to-day. In fact, from the point of
view of plant evolution, it is almost an arbitrary and
unnecessary distinction to separate the Tertiary epoch
from the present, because the main features of the
vegetation are so similar. There are, however, such
important differences in the distribution of the plants
of the Tertiary and those of the present times, that
the distinction is advisable; but it must always be remembered
that it is not comparable with the wide
differences between the other epochs.</p>
<p>Among the plants now living we find representatives
of most, though not of all, of the great <i>groups</i> of
plants which have flourished in the past, though in the
course of time all the species have altered and those of
the earliest earth periods have become extinct. The
relative importance of the different groups changes
greatly in the various periods, and as we proceed
through the ages of time we see the dominant place
in the plant world held successively by increasingly
advanced types, while the plants which dominated earlier
epochs dwindle and take a subordinate position. For
example, the great trees of the Carboniferous period
belonged to the Lycopod family, which to-day are
represented by small herbs creeping along the ground.
The Cycad-like plants of the Mesozoic, which grew in
such luxuriance and in such variety, are now restricted
to a small number of types scattered over the world in
isolated localities.</p>
<p>During all the periods of which we have any knowledge
there existed a rich and luxuriant vegetation
composed of trees, large ferns, and small herbs of
various kinds, but the members of this vegetation have
changed fundamentally with the changing earth, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
unlike the earth in her rock-forming they have never
repeated themselves.</p>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">STAGES IN PLANT EVOLUTION</span></h2>
<p>To attempt any discussion of the <i>causes</i> of evolution
is far beyond the scope of the present work. At present
we must accept life as we find it, endowed with an endless
capacity for change and a continuous impulse to
advance. We can but study in some degree the <i>course</i>
taken by its changes.</p>
<p>From the most primitive beginnings of the earliest
periods, enormous advance had been made before we
have any detailed records of the forms. Yet there
remain in the world of to-day numerous places where
the types with the simplest structure can still flourish,
and successfully compete with higher forms. Many
places which, from the point of view of the higher plants,
are undesirable, are well suited to the lower. Such
places, for example, as the sea, and on land the small
nooks and crannies where water drops collect, which
are useless for the higher plants, suffice for the minute
forms. In some cases the lower plants may grow in
such masses together as to capture a district and keep
the higher plants from it. Equisetum (the horsetail)
does this by means of an extensive system of underground
rhizomes which give the plant a very strong
hold on a piece of land which favours it, so that the
flowering plants may be quite kept from growing there.</p>
<p>In such places, by a variety of means, plants are
now flourishing on the earth which represent practically
all the main stages of development of plant life as a
whole. It is to the study of the simpler of the living
forms that we owe most of our conceptions of the course
taken by evolution. Had we to depend on fossil evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
alone, we should be in almost complete ignorance
of the earliest types of vegetation and all the simpler
cohorts of plants, because their minute size and very
delicate structure have always rendered them unsuitable
for preservation in stone. At the same time, had we
none of the knowledge of the numerous fossil forms
which we now possess, there would be great gaps in
the series which no study of living forms could supply.
It is only by a study and comparison of both living and
fossil plants of all kinds and from beds of all ages that
we can get any true conception of the whole scheme of
plant life.</p>
<p>Grouping together all the main families of plants
at present known to us to exist or to have existed, we
get the following series:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>In this table the different groups have not a strictly
equivalent scientific value, but each of those in the
second column represents a large and well-defined
series of primary importance, whose members could
not possibly be included along with any of the other
groups.</p>
<p>Those marked with an asterisk are known only as
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
fossils, and it will be seen that of the seventeen groups,
so many as four are known only in the fossil state.
This indicates, however, but a part of their importance,
for in nearly every other group are many families or
genera which are only known as fossils, though there
are living representatives of the group as a whole.</p>
<p>In this table the individual families are not mentioned,
because for the present we need only the main
outline of classification to illustrate the principal facts
about the course of evolution. As the table is given,
the simplest families come first, the succeeding ones
gradually increasing in complexity till the last group
represents the most advanced type with which we are
acquainted, and the one which is the dominant group
of the present day.</p>
<p>This must not be taken as a suggestion that the
members of this series have evolved directly one from
the other in the order in which they stand in the table.
That is indeed far from the case, and the relations
between the groups are highly complex.</p>
<p>It must be remarked here that it is often difficult,
even impossible, to decide which are the most highly
evolved members of any group of plants. Each individual
of the higher families is a very complicated
organism consisting of many parts, each of which has
evolved more or less independently of the others in
response to some special quality of the surroundings.
For instance, one plant may require, and therefore
evolve, a very complex and well-developed water-carriage
system while retaining a simple type of flower;
another may grow where the water problem does not
trouble it, but where it needs to develop special methods
for getting its ovules pollinated; and so on, in infinite
variety. As a result of this, in almost all plants we have
some organs highly evolved and specialized, and others
still in a primitive or relatively primitive condition. It
is only possible to determine the relative positions of
plants on the scale of development by making an average
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
conclusion from the study of the details of all their
parts. This, however, is beset with difficulties, and in
most cases the scientist, weighed by personal inclinations,
arbitrarily decides on one or other character to
which he pays much attention as a criterion, while
another scientist tends to lay stress on different characters
which may point in another direction.</p>
<p>In no group is this better illustrated than among the
Conifer&aelig;, where the relative arrangement of the different
families included in it is still very uncertain, and where
the observations of different workers, each dealing mainly
with different characters in the plants, tend to contradict
each other.</p>
<p>This, however, as a byword. Notwithstanding these
difficulties, which it would be unfair to ignore, the main
scheme of evolution stands out clearly before the scientist
of to-day, and his views are largely supported by many
important facts from both fossil and living plants.</p>
<p>Very strong evidence points to the conclusion that
the most primitive plants of early time were, like the
simplest plants of to-day, water dwellers. Whether in
fresh water or the sea is an undecided point, though
opinion seems to incline in general to the view that the
sea was the first home of plant life. It can, however,
be equally well, and perhaps even more successfully
argued, that the freshwater lakes and streams were the
homes of the first families from which the higher plants
have gradually been evolved.</p>
<p>For this there is no direct evidence in the rocks, for
the minute forms of the single soft cells assumed by the
most primitive types were just such as one could not
expect to be successfully fossilized. Hence the earliest
stages must be deduced from a comparative study of the
simplest plants now living. Fortunately there is much
material for this in the numerous waters of the earth,
where swarms of minute types in many stages of complexity
are to be found.</p>
<p>The simplest type of plants now living, which appears
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to be capable of evolution on lines which might
have led to the higher plants, is that found in various
members of the group of the Protococcoide&aelig; among the
Alg&aelig;. The claim of bacteria and other primitive organisms
of various kinds to the absolute priority of existence
is one which is entirely beyond the scope of a book dealing
with fossil plants. The early evolution of the simple
types of the Protococcoide&aelig; is also somewhat beyond its
scope, but as they appear to lie on the most direct &ldquo;line
of descent&rdquo; of the majority of the higher plants it cannot
be entirely ignored. From the simpler
groups of the green Alg&aelig; other types
have specialized and advanced along
various directions, but among them
there seems an inherent limitation, and
none but the protococcoid forms seem
to indicate the possibility of really high
development.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/fig17.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="409" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 17.&mdash;A Protococcoid Plant consisting of one cell</p>
<p class="caption"><i>p</i>, Protoplasm; <i>n</i>, nucleus; <i>g</i>, colouring body or chloroplast;
<i>w</i>, cell wall.</p>
<p>In a few words, a typical example
of one of the simple Protococcoide&aelig;
may be described as consisting of a
mass of protoplasm in which lie a recognizable
nucleus and a green colouring
body or chloroplast, with a cell wall or skin surrounding
these vital structures, a cell wall that may at times be
dispensed with or unusually thickened according as the
need arises. This plant is represented in <a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a> in a
somewhat diagrammatic form.</p>
<p>In such a case the whole plant consists of one single
cell, living surrounded by the water, which supplies it
with the necessary food materials, and also protects it
from drying up and from immediate contact with any
hard or injurious object. When these plants propagate
they divide into four parts, each one similar to the
original cell, which all remain together within the main
cell wall for a short time before they separate.</p>
<p>If now we imagine that the four cells do not separate,
but remain together permanently, we can see the possibility
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
of a beginning of specialization in the different
parts of the cell. The single living cell is equally acted
on from all sides, and in itself it must perform all the life
functions; but where four lie together, each of the four
cells is no longer equally acted on from all sides. This
shows clearly in the diagram of a divided cell given in
<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>. Here it is obvious that one side of each of the
four cells, viz. that named <i>a</i> in the diagram, is on the
outside and in direct contact with the water and external
things; but walls <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> touch only the corresponding
walls of the neighbouring cells. Through
walls <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> no food and water can enter
directly, but at the same time they are
protected from injury and external stimulus.
Hence, in this group of four cells
there is a slight differentiation of the
sides of the cells. If now we imagine
that each of the four cells, still remaining
in contact, divides once more into four
members, each of which reaches mature
size while all remain together, then we
have a group of sixteen cells, some of
which will be entirely inside, and some
of which will have walls exposed to the environment.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 18.&mdash;Diagram of Protococcoid Cell divided
into four daughter cells. Walls <i>a</i> are external, and walls <i>b</i> and
<i>c</i> in contact with each other.</p>
<p>If the cells of the group all divide again, in the
manner shown the mass will become more than one cell
thick, and the inner cells will be more completely differentiated,
for they will be entirely cut off from the
outside and all direct contact with water and food
materials, and will depend on what the outer cells
transmit to them. The outer cells will become specialized
for protection and also for the absorption of the
water and salts and air for the whole mass. From
such a plastic group of green cells it is probable that
the higher and increasingly complex forms of plants
have evolved. There are still living plants which correspond
with the groups of four, sixteen, &amp;c., cells just
now theoretically stipulated.</p>

<p>The higher plants of to-day all consist of very large
numbers of cells forming tissues of different kinds,
each of which is specialized more or less, some very
elaborately, for the performance of certain functions of
importance for the plant body as a whole. With the
increase in the number of cells forming the solid plant
body, the number of those living wholly cut off from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
outside becomes increasingly great in comparison with
those forming the external layer. Some idea of the
complexity and differentiation of this cell mass is given
in <a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>, <span class="small">A</span>, which shows the relative sizes and shapes
of the cells composing a small part of the stem of a
common flowering plant. The complete section would
be circular and the groups <span class="small">V</span> would be repeated round
it symmetrically, and the whole would be enclosed by
an unbroken layer of the cells marked <i>e</i>, as in the
diagram <span class="small">B</span>.</p>

<i>b</i>, food-conducting cells; <i>ss</i>, strengthening cells; <i>p</i>, general ground tissue.</p>
<p>In the tissues of the higher plants the most important
feature is the complex system of conducting tissues,
shown in the young condition in <span class="small">V</span> in <a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>, <span class="small">A</span>. In
them the food and water conducting elements are very
much elongated and highly specialized cells, which run
between the others much like a system of pipes in the
brickwork of a house. These cells are shown cut longitudinally
in <a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>, where they are lettered to correspond
with the cells in <a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>, <span class="small">A</span>, with which they should be
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
compared. In such a view the great difference between
the highly specialized cells <i>x</i>, <i>px</i>, <i>b</i>, &amp;c., and those of
the main mass of ground tissue <i>p</i> becomes apparent.</p>
<p>Even in the comparatively simply organized groups
of the Equisetales and Lycopodiales the differentiation
of tissues is complete. In the mosses, and still more
in the liverworts, it is rudimentary; but they grow in
very damp situations, where the conduction of water
and the protection from too much drying is not a difficult
problem for them. As plants grow higher into the air,
or inhabit drier situations, the need of specialization of
tissues becomes increasingly great, for they are increasingly
liable to be dried, and therefore need a better flow
of water and a more perfect protective coat.</p>
<p>It is needless to point out how the individual cells of
a plant, such as that figured in figs. <a href="#fig19">19</a> and <a href="#fig20">20</a>, have
specialized away from the simple type of the protococcoid
cell in their mature form. In the young growing
parts of a plant, however, they are essentially like protococcoid
cells of squarish outline, fitting closely to each
other to make a solid mass, from which the individual
types will differentiate later and take on the form suitable
for the special part they have to play in the economy
of the whole plant.</p>
<p>To trace the specialization not only of the tissues
but of the various parts of the whole plant which have
become elaborate organs, such as leaves, stems, and
flowers, is a task quite beyond the present work to
attempt. From the illustrations given of tissue structure
from plants at the two ends of the series much
can be imagined of the inevitable intermediate stages in
tissue evolution.</p>
<p>As regards the elaboration of organs, and particularly
of the reproductive organs, details will be found throughout
the book. In judging of the place of any plant in
the scale of evolution it is to the reproductive organs
that we look for the principal criteria, for the reproductive
organs tend to be influenced less by their physical
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
surroundings than the vegetative organs, and are therefore
truer guides to natural relationships.</p>
<p>In the essential cells of the reproductive organs, viz.
the egg cell and the male cell, we get the most primitively
organized cells in the plant body. In the simpler
families both male and female cells return to the condition
of a free-swimming protococcoid cell, and in all but
the highest families the male cell requires a liquid environment,
in which it <i>swims</i> to the egg cell. In the
higher families the necessary water is provided within
the structure of the seed, and the male cell does not
swim, a naked, solitary cell, out into the wide world,
as it does in all the families up to and including the
Filicales. In the Conifer&aelig; and Angiosperms the male
cell does not swim, but is passive (or largely so), and is
brought to the egg cell. One might almost say that the
whole evolution of the complex structures found in fruiting
cones and flowers is a result of the need of protection
of the delicate, simple reproductive cells and the embryonic
tissues resulting from their fusion. The lower plants
scatter these delicate cells broadcast in enormous numbers,
the higher plants protect each single egg cell by an
elaborate series of tissues, and actually bring the male
cell to it without ever allowing either of them to be
exposed.</p>
<p>It must be assumed that the reader possesses a
general acquaintance with the living families tabulated
on <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>; those of the fossil groups will be given in
some detail in succeeding chapters which deal with the
histories of the various families. It is premature to
attempt any general discussion of the evolution of the
various groups till all have been studied, so that this
will be reserved for the concluding chapters.</p>

<br /><span class="small">MINUTE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS&mdash;LIKENESSES TO LIVING ONES</span></h2>
<p>The individual plants of the Coal Measure period
differed entirely from those now living; they were more
than merely distinct species, for in the main even the
families were largely different from the present ones.
Nevertheless, when we come to examine the minute
anatomy of the fossils, and the cells of which they are
composed, we find that between the living and the
fossil cell types the closest similarity exists.</p>
<p>From the earliest times of which we have any knowledge
the elements of the plant body have been the
same, though the types of structures which they built
have varied in plan. Individual <i>cells</i> of nearly every
type from the Coal Measure period can be identically
matched with those of to-day. In the way the walls
thickened, in the shapes of the wood, strengthening
or epidermal cells, in the form of the various tissues
adapted to specific purposes, there is a unity of organization
which it is reasonable to suppose depends on
the fundamental qualities inherent in plant life.</p>
<p>This will be illustrated best, perhaps, by tabulating
the chief modifications of cells which are found in plant
tissues. The illustrations of these types in the following
table are taken from living plants, because from them
figures of more diagrammatic clearness can be made,
and the salient characters of the cells more easily recognized.
Comparison of these typical cells with those illustrated
from the fossil plants reveals their identity in
essential structure, and most of them will be found in
the photos of fossils in these pages, though they are
better recognized in the actual fossils themselves.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>There are, of course, many minor varieties of cells,
but these illustrate all the main types.</p>
<p>Among the early fossils, however, one type of wood
cell and one type of bast cell, so far as we know, are not
present. These cells are the true <i>vessels</i> of the wood
of flowering plants, and the long bast cells with their
companion proteid cells. The figure of a metaxylem
wood cell, shown in <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>, <i>t</i>, shows the more primitive
type of wood cell, which has an oblique cross wall. This
type of wood cell is found in all the fossil trees, and all
the living plants except the flowering plants. The vessel
type, which is that in the big wood vessels of the flowering
plants, and has no cross wall, is seen in <a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>, <i>x</i>.</p>
<p>The similarity between the living cells and those of
the Coal Measure fossils is sufficiently illustrated to need
no further comment. This similarity is an extremely
helpful point when we come to an interpretation of the
fossils. In living plants we can study the physiology of
the various kinds of cells, and can deduce from experiment
exactly the part they play in the economy of the
whole plant. From a study of the tissues in any plant
structure we know what function it performed, and can
very often estimate the nature of the surrounding conditions
under which the plant was growing. To take a
single example, the palisade tissue, illustrated in <a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>, <i>p</i>,
in living plants always contains green colouring matter,
and lies just below the epidermis, usually of leaves, but
sometimes also of green stems. These cells do most of
the starch manufacture for the plant, and are found best
developed when exposed to a good light. In very shady
places the leaves seldom have this type of cell. Now,
when cells just like these are found in fossils (as is illustrated
in <a href="#fig34">fig. 34</a>), we can assume all the physiological
facts mentioned above, and rest assured that that leaf
was growing under normal conditions of light and was
actively engaged in starch-building when it was alive.
From the physiological standpoint the fossil leaf is
entirely the same as a normal living one.</p>

<i>s</i>, sclerenchyma above the vascular bundle.</p>
<p>From the morphological standpoint, also, the features
of the plant body from the Coal Measure period fall into
the same divisions as those of the present. Roots, stems,
leaves, and reproductive organs, the essentially distinct
parts of a plant, are to be found in a form entirely recognizable,
or sufficiently like that now in vogue to be
interpreted without great difficulty. In the detailed
structure of the reproductive organs more changes have
taken place than in any others, both in internal organization
and external appearance.</p>
<p>Already, in the Early Pal&aelig;ozoic period, the distinction
between leaves, stems, roots, and reproductive organs
was as clearly marked as it is to-day, and, judging by
their structure, they must each have performed the physiological
functions they now do. Roots have changed least
in the course of time, probably because, in the earth, they
live under comparatively uniform conditions in whatever
period of the world&rsquo;s history they are growing. Naturally,
between the roots of different species there are
slight differences; but the likeness between fern roots
from the Pal&aelig;ozoic and from a living fern is absolutely
complete. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>, which shows the
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
microscopic structure of the two roots when cut in transverse
direction. The various tissues will be recognized
as coming into the table on <a href="#Page_54">p. 54</a>, so that both in the
details of individual cells and in the general arrangement
of the cell groups or tissues the roots of these fossil and
living ferns agree.</p>

<p>Among stems there has been at all periods more
variety than among the roots of the corresponding plants,
and in the following chapter, when the differences between
living and fossil plants will be considered, there
will be several important structures to notice. Nevertheless,
there are very many characters in which the
stems from such widely different epochs agree. The
plants in the pal&aelig;ozoic forests were of many kinds, and
among them were those with weak trailing stems which
climbed over and supported themselves on other plants,
and also tall, sturdy shafts of woody trees, many of which
were covered with a corky bark. Leaves were attached
to the stems, either directly, as in the case of some living
plants, or by leaf stalks. In external appearance and in
general function the stems then were as stems are now.
In the details of the individual cells also the likeness is
complete; it is in the grouping of the cells, the anatomy
of the tissues, that the important differences lie. It has
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
been remarked already that increase in complexity of
the plant form usually goes with an increase in complexity
of the cells and variety of the tissues. The
general ground tissue in nearly all plants is very similar;
it is principally in the vascular system that the advance
and variety lie.</p>
<p>Plant anatomists lay particular stress on the vascular
system, which, in comparison with animal anatomy, holds
an even more important position than does the skeleton.
To understand the essential
characters of stems,
both living and fossil, and
to appreciate their points
of likeness or difference,
it is necessary to have
some knowledge of the
general facts of anatomy;
hence the main points on
which stress is laid will
be given now in brief
outline.</p>
<p>Leaving aside consideration
of the more
rudimentary and less defined
structure of the alg&aelig;
and mosses, all plants
may be said to possess a &ldquo;vascular system&rdquo;. This is
typically composed of elongated wood (or xylem) with
accessory cells (see <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>, table), and bast (phloem), also
with accessory cells. These specialized conducting elements
lie in the ground tissue, and in nearly all cases are
cut off from direct contact with it by a definite sheath,
called the endodermis (see <a href="#Page_55">p. 55</a>, <a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>). Very often
there are also groups or rings of hard thick-walled cells
associated with the vascular tissues, which protect them
and play an important part in the consolidation of the
whole stem.</p>

<span class="small">E</span>, enclosing sheath of endodermis; <span class="small">C</span>, ground

<p>The simplest, and probably evolutionally the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
primitive form which is taken by the vascular tissues,
is that of a single central strand, with the wood in the
middle, the bast round
it, and a circular endodermis
enclosing all, as
in <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>, which shows
a diagram of this arrangement.
Such a
mass of wood and bast
surrounded by an endodermis,
is technically
known as a <i>stele</i>, a very
convenient term which
is much used by anatomists.
In its simplest
form (as in <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>) it
is called a <i>protostele</i>,
and is to be found in both living and fossil plants. A
number of plants which get more complex steles later
on, have protosteles in the early stages of their development,
as in <i>Pteris aurita</i>
for example, a species
allied to the bracken
fern, which has a hollow
ring stele when mature.</p>

<p>The next type of
stele is quite similar to
the protostele, but with
the addition of a few
large unspecialized cells
in the middle of the
wood (<i>p</i>, <a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>); these
are the commencement
of the hollowing process
which goes on in the wood, resulting later in the formation
of a considerable pith, as is seen in <a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>, where
the wood is now a hollow cylinder, as the phloem has
been from the first. When this is the case, a second
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
sheath or endodermis generally develops on the inner
side of the wood, outside the pith, and cuts the vascular
tissues off from the inner
parenchyma. A further
step is the development
of an inner cylinder of
bast so that the vascular
ring is completely double,
with endodermis on both
sides of the cylinder, as is
seen in <a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>.</p>

<p>In all these cases there
is but one strand or cylinder,
of vascular tissue in
the stem, but one stele,
and this type of anatomy
is known as the <i>monostelic</i>
or single-steled type.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 40.&mdash;A Ring Stele apparently
broken up into a Number of Protosteles by many Leaf Gaps</p>
<p>When from the double
cylinder just described a strand of tissue goes off to
supply a large leaf, a considerable part of the stele goes
out and breaks the ring. This
is shown in <a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>, where <span class="small">L</span>
is the part of the stele going
to a leaf, and the rest the
broken central cylinder. When
the stem is short, and leaves
grow thickly so that bundles
are constantly going out from
the main cylinder, this gets
permanently broken, and its
appearance when cut across at
any given point is that of a
group of several steles arranged
in a ring, each separate stele
being like the simple protostele
in its structure. See <a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>. This type of stem
has long been known as <i>polystelic</i> (<i>i.e.</i> many-steled), and
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
it is still a convenient term to describe it by. There
has been much theoretical discussion about the true
meaning of such a &ldquo;polystelic&rdquo; stem, which cannot be
entered into here; it may be noted, however, that the
various strands of the broken ring join up and form a
meshwork when we consider the stem as a whole, it is
only in a single section that they appear as quite independent
protosteles. Nevertheless, as we generally consider
the anatomy of stems in terms of single sections,
and as the descriptive word
&ldquo;polystelic&rdquo; is a very convenient
and widely understood
term, it will be used
throughout the book when
speaking of this type of
stem anatomy.</p>
<p>Such a type as this,
shown in <a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>, is already
complex, but it often happens
that the steles branch
and divide still further, until
there is a highly complicated
and sometimes bewildering
system of vascular strands
running through the ground
tissue in many directions, but cut off from it by their
protective endodermal sheaths. Such complex systems
are to be found both in living and fossil plants, more
especially in many of the larger ferns (see <a href="#fig88">fig. 88</a>).</p>
<p>Higher plants in general, however, and in particular
flowering plants, do not have a polystelic vascular
arrangement, but a specialized type of monostele.</p>

<p>Referring again to <a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a> as a starting-point, imagine
the pith in the centre to spread in a star-shaped form
till the points of the star touched the edges of the ring,
and thus to break the wood ring into groups. A stage
in this process (which is not yet completed) is shown
in <a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>, while in <a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a> the wood and bast groups
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
are entirely distinct. In the flowering plants the cells
of the endodermis are frequently poorly characterized,
and the pith cells resemble
those of the cortical ground
tissue, so that the separate
groups of wood and bast
(usually known as &ldquo;vascular
bundles&rdquo;, in distinction from
the &ldquo;steles&rdquo; of <a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>) appear
to lie independently in
the ground tissue. These
strands, however, must not
be confused with steles, they
are only fragments of the
single apparently broken up
stele which runs in the stem.</p>

by a ring of wood, see <a href="#fig43">fig. 43</a>, to
which are added further rings
every season, till the mass of wood
becomes a strong solid shaft. This ever-recurring
activity of the cambium gives rise to what are known as
&ldquo;annual rings&rdquo; in stems, see <a href="#fig44">fig. 44</a>, in which the wood
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
shows both primary distinct groups in the centre, and
the rings of growth of later years.</p>
<p>Cambium with this power of long-continued activity
is found in nearly all the higher plants of to-day (except
the Monocotyledons), but in the fern and lycopod groups
it is in abeyance. Certain cases from nearly every
family of the Pteridophytes are known, where some
slight development of cambium with its secondary
thickening takes place, but in the groups below
the Gymnosperms cambium has almost no part
to play. On the other hand, so far back as the
Carboniferous period, the masses of wood in the
Pteridophyte trees were formed by cambium in
just the same way as they are now in the
higher forms. Its presence was almost universal
at that time in the lower groups where to-day
there are hardly any traces of it to be found.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this short outline of the vascular
system of plants, that there is much variety possible
from modifications of the fundamental protostele. It is
also to be noted that the plants of the Coal Measures
had already evolved all the main varieties of steles which
are known to us even now,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
and that the development
of secondary thickening was very widespread. In
several cases the complexity of type exceeds that of
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
modern plants (see <a href="#c7">Chap. VII</a>), and there are to be
found vascular arrangements no longer extant.</p>
<p>When we turn to the <i>Reproductive Organs</i>, we find
that the points of likeness between the living and the fossil forms
are not so numerous or so direct as they are in the case of the
vegetative system.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="small">A</span>, fossil; <span class="small">B</span>, living.</p>
<p>As has been indicated, the families of plants typical of the
Coal Measures were not those which are the most
prominent to-day, but belonged to the lower series of
Pteridophytes. In their simpler forms the fructifications
then and now resemble each other very closely, but in the more elaborate
developments the points of variety are more striking, so
that they will be dealt with in the following chapter. Cases of likeness
are seen in the sporangia of ferns, some of which appear
to have been practically identical with those now living.
This is illustrated in <a href="#fig45">fig. 45</a>, which shows the outline of the cells
of the sporangia of living and fossil side by side.</p>

<p>In the general structure also of the cones of the
simpler types of <i>Lepidodendron</i> (fossil, see <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>)
there is a close agreement with the living Lycopods,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
though as regards size and output of spores there was
a considerable difference in favour of the fossils. The
plan of each is that round the axis of the cone simple
scales are arranged, on each of which, on its upper side,
is seated a large sporangium bearing numerous spores
all of one kind (see <a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>).</p>
<p>Equally similar are the cones of the living Equisetum
and some of the simple members of the fossil family
Calamite&aelig;, but the more interesting cases are those where
differences of an important morphological nature are to be seen.</p>
<p>As regards the second<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
generation there is some very important evidence, from extremely
young stages, which has recently been given to the world. In a fern sporangium
<i>germinating spores</i> were fossilized so as to show the first
divisions of the spore cell. These seem to be identical
with the first divisions of some recent ferns (see <a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>).
This is not only of interest as showing the close similarity
in detail between plants of such widely different
ages, but is a remarkable case of delicate preservation
of soft and most perishable structures in the &ldquo;coal
balls&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While these few cases illustrate points of likeness
between the fructifications of the Coal Measures and of
to-day, the large size and successful character of the
primitive Coal Measure plants was accompanied by many
developments on the part of their reproductive organs
which are no longer seen in living forms, and the greater
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
number of pal&aelig;ozoic fructifications must be considered
in the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">MINUTE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS&mdash;DIFFERENCES FROM LIVING ONES</span></h2>
<p>We have seen in the last chapter that the main
morphological divisions, roots, stems, leaves, and fructifications,
were as distinct in the Coal Measure period as
they are now. There is one structure, however, found
in the Coal Measure fossils, which is hardly paralleled
by anything similar in the living plants, and that is
the fossil known as <i>Stigmaria</i>. <i>Stigmaria</i> is the name
given, not to a distinct species of plant, but to the large
rootlike organs which we know to have belonged to all
the species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and of <i>Sigillaria</i>. In the
<a href="#front">frontispiece</a> these organs are well seen, and branch away
at the foot of the trunk, spreading horizontally, to all
appearance merely large roots. They are especially
regularly developed, however, the main trunk giving
rise always to four primary branches, these each dividing
into two equal branches, and so on&mdash;in this they are
unlike the usual roots of trees. They bore numerous
rootlets, of which we know the structure very well, as
they are the commonest of all fossils, but in their internal
anatomy the main &ldquo;roots&rdquo; had not the structure
which is characteristic of roots, but were like <i>stems</i>. In
living plants there are many examples of stems which
run underground, but they always have at least the
rudiments of leaves in the form of scales, while the
fossil structures have apparently no trace of even the
smallest scales, but bear only rootlets, thus resembling
true roots. The questions of morphology these structures
raise are too complex to be discussed here, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Stigmaria is only introduced as an example, one of
the very few available, of a pal&aelig;ozoic structure which
seems to be of a nature not clearly determinable as
either root, stem, leaf, or fructification. Among living
plants the fine rootlike rhizophores of Selaginella bear
some resemblance to Stigmaria in essentials, though so
widely different from them in many ways, and they
are probably the closest analogy to be found among
the plants of to-day.</p>
<p>The individual cells, we have already seen, are
strikingly similar in the case of
fossil and living plants. There
are, of course, specific varieties
peculiar to the fossils, of which
perhaps the most striking seem to
be some forms of <i>hair</i> cells. For
example, in a species of fern from
the French rocks there were multicellular
hairs which looked like
little stems of Equisetum owing
to regular bands of teeth at the
junctions of the cells. These hairs
were quite characteristic of the
species&mdash;but hairs of all sorts
have always abounded in variety, so that such distinction
has but minor significance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 48.&mdash;Stele of <i>Lepidodendron</i>
<span class="small">W</span>, surrounded by a small
ring of secondary wood <span class="small">S</span></p>
<p>As was noted in the table (<a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>) the only cell types
of prime importance which were not evolved by the
Pal&aelig;ozoic plants were the wood vessels, phloem and
accompanying cells which are characteristic of the
flowering plants.</p>
<p>Among the fossils the vascular arrangements are
most interesting, and, as well as all the types of stele
development noted in the previous chapter as common
to both living and fossil plants, there are further varieties
found only among the fossils (see <a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>).</p>
<p>The simple protostele described (on <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>) is still
found, particularly in the very young stages of living
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
ferns, but it is a type of vascular arrangement which
is not common in the mature plants of the present day.
In the Coal Measure period, however, the protostele was
characteristic of one of the two main groups of ferns. In
different species of these ferns, the protostele assumed
a large variety of shapes and forms as well as the simple
cylindrical type. The central mass of wood became five-rayed
in some, star-shaped, and even very deeply lobed,
with slightly irregular arms, but in all these cases it remained
fundamentally monostelic. Frequently secondary
tissue developed round the protosteles of plants whose
living relatives have no such tissue. A case of this kind
is illustrated in <a href="#fig48">fig. 48</a>, which shows a simple circular
stele surrounded by a zone of secondary woody tissue
in a species of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 49.&mdash;<i>Lepidodendron</i>, showing Part of the Hollow Ring of Primary Wood <span class="small">W</span>, with
a relatively large amount of Secondary Tissue <span class="small">S</span>, surrounding it</p>
<p>In many species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> the quantity of
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
secondary wood formed round the primary stele was
very great, so that (as is the case in higher plants) the
primary wood became relatively insignificant compared
with it. In most species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> the primary
stele is a hollow ring of wood (cf. <a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>) round
which the secondary wood developed, as is seen in <a href="#fig49">fig. 49</a>.
These two cases illustrate a peculiarity of fossil plants.
Among living ones the solid and the simple ring stele
are almost confined to the Pteridophytes, where secondary
wood does not develop, but the pal&aelig;ozoic Pteridophytes,
while having the simple primary types of steles, had
quantities of secondary tissue, which was correlated
with their large size and dominant position.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 50.&mdash;Diagram of Steles of  the English
<i>Medullosa</i>, showing three irregular, solid, steles
<span class="small">A</span>, with secondary thickenings <span class="small">S</span>, all round each.
<i>a</i>, Small accessory steles</p>
<p>Among <i>polystelic</i>
types (see <a href="#Page_63">p. 63</a>) we
find interesting examples
in the fossil group of the <i>Medullose&aelig;</i>,
which are much more complex than any known at
present, both owing to their primary structure and also
to the peculiar fact that all the steles developed secondary
tissue towards the inner as well as the outer side.
One of the simpler members of this family found in the
English Coal Measures is illustrated in <a href="#fig50">fig. 50</a>. Here
there are three principal protosteles (and several irregular
minor ones) each of which has a considerable quantity of
secondary tissue all round it, so that a portion of the secondary
wood is growing in towards the actual centre of
the stem as a whole&mdash;a very anomalous state of affairs.</p>
<p>In the more complex Continental type of <i>Medullosa</i>
there are <i>very</i> large numbers of steles. In the one
figured from the Continent in <a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a> but a few are represented.
There is a large outer double-ring stele, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
secondary wood on both sides of it, and within these a
number of small steles, all scattered through the ground
tissue, and each surrounded by secondary wood. In
actual specimens the number of these central steles is
much greater than that indicated in the diagram.</p>
<p>No plant exists to-day which has such an arrangement
of its vascular cylinder. It almost appears as though at
the early period, when the Medullose&aelig; flourished, steles
were experimenting in various directions. Such types
as are illustrated in figs. <a href="#fig50">50</a> and <a href="#fig51">51</a> are obviously wasteful
(for secondary wood developing towards the centre
of a stem is bound to finally meet), and complex, but
apparently inefficient, which may partly account for the
fact that this type of structure has not survived to the
present, though simpler and equally ancient types have done so.</p>

<p>Further details of the anatomy of fossils will be
mentioned when we come to consider the individual
families; those now illustrated suffice to show that in
the Coal Measures very different arrangements of steles
were to be found, as well as those which were similar
to those existing now. The significance of these differences
will become apparent when their relation to the
other characters of the plants is considered.</p>
<p>The fructifications, always the most important parts
of the plant, offer a wide field, and the divergence between
the commoner pal&aelig;ozoic and recent types seems
at first to be very great. Indeed, when pal&aelig;ozoic reproductive
bodies have to be described, it is often necessary
to use the common descriptive terms in an altered and
wider sense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Among the plants of to-day there are many varieties
of the simple single-celled reproductive masses which
are called <i>spores</i>, and which are usually formed in large
numbers inside a spore case or sporangium. Among the
higher plants <i>seeds</i> are also known in endless variety, all
of which, compared with spores, are very complex, for
they are many-celled structures, consisting essentially of
an embryo or young plant enclosed in various protective
coats. The distinction between the two is sharp
and well defined, and for the student of living plants
there exists no difficulty in separating and describing
seeds and spores.</p>
<p>But when we look back through the past eras to
pal&aelig;ozoic plants the subject is not so easy, and the two
main types of potentially reproductive masses are not
sharply distinct. The seed, as we know it among
recent plants, and as it is generally defined, had not
fully evolved; while the spores were of great variety
and had evolved in several directions, some of which
seem to have been intermediate stages between simple
spores and true seeds. These seedlike spores served
to reproduce the plants of the period, but their type
has since died out and left but two main methods among
living plants, namely the essentially simple spores, the
very simplicity of whose organization gives them a secure
position, and the complex seeds with their infinite variety
of methods for protecting and scattering the young embryos
they contain.</p>
<p>Among the Coal Measure fossils we can pick up some
of the early stages in the evolution of the seed from the
spore, or at least we can examine intermediate stages
between them which give some idea of the possible
course of events. Hence, though the differences from
our modern reproductive structures are so noticeable a
feature of the pal&aelig;ozoic ones, it will be seen that they
are really such differences as exist between the members
at the two ends of a series, not such as exist between
unrelated objects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Very few types can be mentioned here, and to make
their relations clear a short series of diagrams with
explanations will be found more helpful than a detailed
account of the structures.</p>

<p>These few illustrations represent only the main divisions
of an army of structures with an almost unimaginable
wealth of variety which must be left out of
consideration.</p>
<p>For the structures illustrated in figs. <a href="#fig54">54</a>, <a href="#fig55">55</a>, and <a href="#fig56">56</a>
we have no name, for their possible existence was not
conceived of when our terminology was invented, and
no one has yet christened them anew with distinct
names. They are evidently too complex in organization
and too similar to seeds in several ways to be called
spores, yet they lack the essential element in a seed,
namely, an embryo. The term &ldquo;ovule&rdquo; (usually given
to the young seed which has not yet developed an
embryo) does not fit them any better, for their tissues
are ripened and hard, and they were of large size and
apparently fully grown and mature.</p>
<p>For the present a name is not essential; the one
thing that is important is to recognize their intermediate
character and the light they throw on the possible evolution
of modern seeds.</p>
<p>A further point of great interest is the manner in
which these &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; were borne on the plant. To-day
seeds are always developed (with the exception of Cycas)
in cones or flowers, or at least special inflorescences.
But the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of <i>Lagenostoma</i> (<a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>), as well as a
number of others in the group it represents, were not
borne on a special structure, but directly on the green
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
foliage leaves. They were in this on a level with the
simple sporangia of ferns which appear on the backs of
the fronds, a fact which is of great significance both for
our views on the evolution of seeds as such, and for the
bearing it has on the relationships of the various groups
of allied plants. This will be referred to subsequently
(Chapter XI), and is mentioned now only as an example
of the difference between some of the characters of early
fossils and those of the present day.</p>
<p>It is true that botanists have long recognized the
organ which bears seeds as a modified leaf. The carpels
of all the higher plants are looked on as <i>homologous</i> with
leaves, although they do not appear to be like them
externally. Sometimes among living plants curious
diseases cause the carpels to become foliar, and when
this happens the diseased carpel reverts more or less to
the supposed ancestral leaf-like condition. It is only
among the ancient (but recently discovered) fossils, however,
that seeds are known to be borne normally on
foliage leaves.</p>
<p>From Mesozoic plants we shall learn new conceptions
about flowers and reproductive inflorescences in general,
but these must be deferred to the consideration of the
family as a whole (Chapter XIII).</p>
<p>Enough has been illustrated to show that though
the individual cells, the bricks, so to speak, of plant
construction, were so similar in the past and present,
yet the organs built up by them have been continually
varying, as a child builds increasingly ambitious palaces
with the same set of bricks.</p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">I. Flowering Plants, Angiosperms</span></h2>
<p>In comparison with the other groups of plants the
flowering families are of recent origin, yet in the sense
in which the word is usually used they are ancient
indeed, and the earliest records of them must date at
least to periods hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Through all the Tertiary period (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>) there
were numerous flowering plants, and there is evidence
that many families of both Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons
existed in the Upper Cretaceous times. Further
back than this we have little reliable testimony, for the
few specimens of so-called flowering plants from the
Lower Mesozoic are for the most part of a doubtful
nature.</p>
<p>The flowering plants seem to stand much isolated
from the rest of the plant world; there is no <i>direct</i> evidence
of connection between their oldest representatives
and any of the more primitive families. So far as our
actual knowledge goes, they might have sprung into
being at the middle of the Mesozoic period quite independently
of the other plants then living; though there
are not wanting elaborate and almost convincing theories
of their connection with more than one group of their
predecessors (see <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>).</p>
<p>It is a peculiarly unfortunate fact that although the
rocks of the Cretaceous and Tertiary are so much less
ancient than those of the Coal Measures, they have preserved
for us far less well the plants which were living
when they were formed. Hitherto no one has found in
Mesozoic strata masses of exquisitely mineralized Angiosperm
fragments<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>
like those found in the Coal Measures,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
which tell us so much about the more ancient plants.
Cases are known of more or less isolated fragments with
their microscopical tissues mineralized. For example,
there are some palms and ferns from South America
which show their anatomical structure very clearly preserved
in silica, and which seem to resemble closely the
living species of their genera. The bulk of the plants
preserved from these periods are found in the form of
casts or impressions (see <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>), which, as has been
pointed out already, are much less satisfactory to deal
with, and give much less reliable results than specimens
which have also their internal structure petrified. The
quantity of material, however, is great, and impressions
of single leaves innumerable, and of specimens of leaves
attached to stems, and even of flowers and fruits, are to
be found in the later beds of rock. These are generally
clearly recognizable as belonging to one or other of
the living families of flowering plants. Leaf impressions
are by far the most frequent, and our knowledge
of the Tertiary flora is principally derived from a study
of them. Their outline and their veins are generally
preserved, often also their petioles and some indication
of the thickness and character of the fleshy part of the
leaf. From the outline and veins alone an expert is
generally able to determine the species to which the
plant belongs, though it is not always quite safe to
trust to these determinations or to draw wide-reaching
conclusions from them.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig59">fig. 59</a> is shown a photograph of the impression
of a Tertiary leaf, which illustrates the condition of an
average good specimen from rocks of the period. Its
shape and the character of the veins are sufficient to
mark it out immediately as belonging to the Dicotyledonous
group of the flowering plants.</p>
<p>Seeds and fruits are also to be found; and in some
very finely preserved specimens from Japan stamens
from a flower and delicate seeds are seen clearly impressed
on the light stone. In <a href="#fig60">fig. 60</a> is illustrated a
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
couple of such seeds, which show not only their wings
but also the small antenn&aelig;-like
stigmas. Specimens so perfectly
preserved are practically as good
as herbarium material of recent
plants, and in this way the externals
of the Tertiary plants are
pretty well known to us.</p>

<p>A problem which has long been discussed, and which has aroused
much interest, is the relative antiquity of the Monocotyledonous
and the Dicotyledonous branches of the flowering plants. A peculiar
fascination seems to hang over this still unsolved riddle,
and a battle of flowers may be said to rage between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
lily and the rose for priority. Recent work has thrown
no decisive light on the question, but it has undoubtedly
demolished the old view which supposed that the Monocotyledons
(the lily group) appeared at a far earlier date
upon this earth than the Dicotyledons. The old writers
based their contention on incorrectly determined fossils.
For instance, seeds from the Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks were described
as Monocotyledons because of the three or six
ribs which were so characteristic of their shell; we know
now that these seeds (<i>Trigonocarpus</i>) belong to a family
already mentioned in another connection (<a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>), the
Medullose&aelig; (see <a href="#Page_122">p. 122</a>), the affinity of which lies
between the cycads and the ferns. Leaves of <i>Cordaites</i>,
again, which are broad and long with well-marked
parallel veins, were described as those of a Monocotyledonous
plant like the Yucca of to-day; but we
now know them to belong to a family of true Gymnosperms
possibly distantly related to <i>Taxus</i> (the Yew tree).</p>
<p>Recent work, which has carefully sifted the fossil
evidence, can only say that no true Monocotyledons
have yet been found below the Lower Cretaceous rocks,
and that at that period we see also the sudden inrush of
Dicotyledons. Hence, so far as pal&aelig;ontology can show,
the two parallel groups of the flowering plants arose
about the same time. It is of interest to note, however,
that the only petrifaction of a flower known from any
part of the world is an ovary which seems to be that
of one of the Liliace&aelig;. In the same nodules, however,
there are several specimens of Dicotyledonous woods,
so that it does not throw any light on the question of
priority.</p>
<p>With the evidence derived from the comparative
study of the anatomy of recent flowering plants we
cannot concern ourselves here, beyond noting that the
results weigh in favour of the Dicotyledons as being
the more primitive, though not necessarily developed
much earlier in point of time. Until very much more
is discovered than is yet known of the origin of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
flowering plants as a whole, it is impossible to come to
a more definite conclusion about this much-discussed
subject.</p>
<p>Let us now attempt to picture the vegetable communities
since the appearance of the flowering plants.
The facts which form the bases of the following conceptions
have been gathered from many lands by numerous
workers in the field of fossil botany, from scattered plant
remains such as have been described.</p>
<p>When the flowering plants were heralded in they
appeared in large numbers, and already by the Cretaceous
period there were very many different species.
Of these a number seem to belong to genera which are
still living, and many of them are extremely like living
species. It would be wearisome and of little value to
give a list of all the recorded species from this period,
but a few of the commoner ones may be mentioned to
illustrate the nature of the plants then flourishing.</p>
<p>Several species of <i>Quercus</i> (the Oak) appeared early,
particularly <i>Quercus Ilex</i>; leaves of the <i>Juglandace&aelig;</i>
(Walnut family) were very common, and among the
Tertiary fossils appear its fruits. Both <i>Populus</i> (the
Poplar) and <i>Salix</i> (the Willow) date from the early
rocks, while <i>Ficus</i> (the Fig) was very common, and
<i>Casuarina</i> (the Switch Plant) seems to have been widely
spread. Magnolias also were common, and it appears
that <i>Platanus</i> (the Plane) and <i>Eucalyptus</i> coexisted with
them.</p>
<p>It will be immediately recognized that the above
plants have all living representatives, either wild or
cultivated, growing in this country at the present day,
so that they are more or less familiar objects, and there
appears to have been no striking difference between the
early flowering plants and those of the present day. Between
the ancient Lycopods, for example, and those now
living the differences are very noteworthy; but the earliest
of the known flowering plants seem to have been essentially
like those now flourishing. It must be remembered
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in this connection that the existing flowering
plants are immensely nearer in point of time to their
origin than are the existing Lycopods, and that when
such &aelig;ons have passed as divide the present from the
Pal&aelig;ozoic, the flowering plants of the future may have
dwindled to a subordinate position corresponding to that
held by the Lycopods now.</p>
<p>A noticeable character of the early flowering-plant
flora, when taken as a whole, is the relatively large
proportion of plants in it which belong to the family
<i>Amentifer&aelig;</i> (oaks, willows, poplars, &amp;c.). This is supposed
by some to indicate that the family is one of
the most primitive stocks of the Angiosperms. This
view, however, hardly bears very close scrutiny, because
it derives its main support from the large numbers of the
Amentifer&aelig; as compared with other groups. Now, the
Amentifer&aelig; were (and are) largely woody resistant plants,
whose very nature would render them more liable to be
preserved as impressions than delicate trees or herbs,
which would more readily decay and leave no trace.
Similarly based on uncertain evidence is the surmise
that the group of flowers classed as <i>Gamopetal&aelig;</i> (flowers
with petals joined up in a tube, like convolvulus) did
not flourish in early times, but are the higher and later
development of the flower type. Now, <i>Viburnum</i> (allied
to the honeysuckle) belongs to this group, and it is
found right down in the Cretaceous, and <i>Sambucus</i>
(Elder, of the same family) is known in the early Tertiary.
These two plants are woody shrubs or small
trees, while many others of the family are herbs, and it
is noteworthy that it is just these woody, resistant forms
which are preserved as fossils; their presence demonstrates
the antiquity of the group as a whole, and the
absence of other members of it may be reasonably attributed
to accidents of preservation. In the Tertiary also
we get a member of the heath family, viz. <i>Andromeda</i>,
and another tube-flower, <i>Bignonia</i>, as well as several
more <i>woody</i> gamopetalous flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Hence it is wise to be very cautious about drawing
any important conclusions from the relative numbers of
the different species, or the absence of any type of plant
from the lists of those as yet known from the Cretaceous.
When quantities of structurally preserved material can
be examined containing the flowering plants in petrifactions,
then it will be possible to speak with some security
of the nature of the Mesozoic flora as a whole.</p>
<p>The positive evidence which is already accumulated,
however, is of great value, and from it certain deductions
may be safely made. Specimens of Cretaceous plants
from various parts of the world seem to indicate that
there was a very striking uniformity in the flora of that
period all over the globe. In America and in Central
Europe, for example, the same types of plants were
growing. We shall see that, as time advanced, the various
types became separated out, dying away in different
places, until each great continent and division of land
had a special set of plants of its own. At the commencement
of the reign of flowering plants, however,
they seem to have lived together in the way we are
told the beasts first lived in the garden of Eden.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Tertiary period there were
still many tropical forms, such as Palms, Cycads, <i>Nipa</i>,
various <i>Artocarpace&aelig;</i>, <i>Laurace&aelig;</i>, <i>Araliace&aelig;</i>, and others,
growing side by side with such temperate forms as
<i>Quercus</i>, <i>Alnus</i>, <i>Betula</i>, <i>Populus</i>, <i>Viburnum</i>, and others
of the same kind. Before the middle of the Tertiary
was reached the last Cycads died in what is now known
as Europe; and soon after the middle Tertiary all the
tropical types died out of this zone.</p>
<p>At the same time those plants whose leaves appear
to have fallen at the end of the warm season began to
become common, which is taken as an indication of a
climatic influence at work. Some writers consider that
in the Cretaceous times there was no cold season, and
therefore no regular period of leaf fall, but as the
climate became temperate the deciduous trees increased
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
in numbers; yet the Gymnospermic and Angiospermic
woods which are found with petrified structure show
well-marked annual rings and seem to contradict this
view.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Tertiary times there were
practically no more tropical forms in the European flora,
though there still remained a number of plants which are
now found either only in America or only in Asia.</p>
<p>The Glacial epoch at the close of the Tertiary appears
to have driven all the plants before it, and afterwards,
when its glaciers retreated, shrinking up to the North
and up the sides of the high mountains, the plant
species that returned to take possession of the land in
the Quaternary or present period were those which are
still inhabiting it, and the floras of the tropics, Asia, and
America were no longer mixed with that of Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">II. Higher Gymnosperms</span></h2>
<p>The more recent history of the higher Gymnosperms,
in the Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary periods, much
resembles that of the flowering plants as sketched in the
previous chapter. Many of the genera appear to have
been those still living, and some of the species even may
have come very close to or have been identical with
those of to-day. The forms now characteristic of the
different continents were growing together, and appear
to have been widely distributed over the globe. For
example, <i>Sequoia</i> and <i>Taxodium</i>, two types now characteristic
of America, and <i>Glyptostrobus</i>, at present found
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
in Asia, were still growing with the other European types
in Europe so late as middle Tertiary times.</p>
<p>As in the case of the Angiosperms, the fossils we
have of Cretaceous and Tertiary Gymnosperms are nearly
all impressions and casts, though some more or less isolated
stems have their structure preserved. Hence our
knowledge of these later Gymnosperms is far from complete.
From the older rocks, however, we have both
impressions and microscopically preserved material, and
are more fully acquainted with them than with those
which lived nearer our own time. Hard, resistant leaves,
which are so characteristic of most of the living genera
of Gymnosperms, seem to have been also developed in
the past members of the group, and these tend to leave
clear impressions in the rocks, so that we have reliable
data for reconstructing the external appearance of the
fossil forms from the Pal&aelig;ozoic period.</p>
<p>The resinous character of Gymnosperm wood probably
greatly assisted its preservation, and fragments of
it are very common in rocks of all ages, generally preserved
in silica so as to show microscopic structure.
The isolated wood of Gymnosperms, however, is not
very instructive, for from the wood alone (and usually
it is just fragments of the secondary wood which are
preserved) but little of either physiological or evolutional
value can be learned. When twigs with primary tissues
and bark and leaves attached are preserved, then the
specimens are of importance, for their true character
can be recognized. Fortunately among the coal balls
there are many such fragments, some of which are
accompanied by fruits and male cones, so that we know
much of the Pal&aelig;ozoic Gymnosperms, and find that in
some respects they differ widely from those now living.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, much more to be said about the
fossil Gymnosperms than about the Angiosperms, both
because of the better quality of their preservation and
because their history dates back to a very much earlier
period than does the Angiospermic record. Indeed, we
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
do not know when the Gymnosperms began; the well-developed
and ancient group of <i>Cordaite&aelig;</i> was flourishing
before the Carboniferous period, and must therefore
date back to the rocks of which we have no reliable
information from this point of view, and the origin of
the Gymnosperms must lie in the pre-Carboniferous
period.</p>
<p>The group of Gymnosperms includes a number of
genera of different types, most of which may be arranged
under seven principal families. In a sketch of this nature
it is, of course, quite impossible to deal with all the less-important
families and genera. Those that will be
considered here are the following:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p>We must pay the most attention to the two last
groups, as they are so important as fossils, and the
<i>Cordaite&aelig;</i> were a very numerous family in Coal Measure
times. They had their period of principal development
so long ago that it is probable that no direct descendants
remain to the present time, though some botanists consider
that the <i>Taxe&aelig;</i> are allied to them.</p>
<p>Of the groups still living it is difficult, almost impossible,
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
to say which is the highest, the most evolved type.
In the consideration of the Gymnosperm family it is
brought home with great emphasis how incomplete and
partial our knowledge is as yet. Many hold that the
<i>Araucare&aelig;</i> are the most primitive of the higher Gymnosperms.
In support of this view the following facts are
noted. They have a simple type of fructification, with
a single seed on a simple scale, and many scales arranged
round an axis to form a cone. In the microscopic structure
of their wood they have double rows of bordered
pits, a kind of wood cell which comes closer to the old
fossil types than does the wood of any of the other living
genera. Further than this, wood which is almost indistinguishable
from the wood of recent Araucarias is found
very far back in the rocks, while their leaves are broad
and simple, and attached directly to the stem in a way
similar to the leaves of the fossil <i>Cordaite&aelig;</i>, and very
different from the needle leaves on the secondary stems
of the Pine family; so that there appears good ground
for considering the group an ancient and probably a
primitive one.<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are not wanting scientists
who consider the <i>Abietine&aelig;</i> the living representatives of
the most primitive and ancient stock, though on the
whole the evidence seems to indicate more clearly that
the Pine-tree group is specialized and highly modified.
Their double series of foliage leaves, their complex cones
(whose structures are not yet fully understood), and their
wood all support the latter view.</p>
<p>Some, again, consider the <i>Taxe&aelig;</i> as a very primitive
group, and would place them near the Cordaite&aelig;, with
which they may be related. Their fleshy seeds, growing
not in cones but on short special axes, support this view,
and it is certainly true that in many ways the large seeds,
with their succulent coats and big endosperm, are much
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
like those of the lower Gymnosperms and of several fossil
types. Those, however, who hold to the view that the
Abietine&aelig; are primitive, see in the <i>Taxe&aelig;</i>
the latest and most modified type of Gymnosperm.</p>
<p>It will be seen from this that there is no lack of
variety regarding the interpretation of Gymnosperm
structures.</p>
<p>The Gymnosperms do not stand in such an isolated
position as do the Angiosperms. Whatever the variety
of views held about the details of the relative placing
of the families within the group, all agree in recognizing
the evidence which enables us to trace with
confidence the connection between the lower Gymnosperms
and the families of ferns. There are many
indications of the intimate connection between higher
and lower Gymnosperms. Between the series exist
what might be described as different degrees of cousinship,
and in the lower groups lie unmistakable clues to
their connection with more ancient groups in the past
which bridge over the gaps between them and the ferns.</p>
<p>For the present, however, let us confine ourselves to
the history of the more important Gymnosperms, the
discussion of their origin and the groups from which they
may have arisen must be postponed until the necessary
details about those groups have been mentioned.</p>
<p>To a consideration of the living families of <i>Araucare&aelig;</i>,
<i>Abietine&aelig;</i>, <i>Cupresse&aelig;</i>, and <i>Taxe&aelig;</i> we can allow
but a short space; their general characters and appearance
are likely to be known to the reader, and their
details can be studied from living specimens if they
are not. For purposes of comparison with the fossils,
however, it will be necessary to mention a few of the
principal features which are of special importance in
discussing phylogeny.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">Araucariace&aelig;</span> are woody trees which attain a
considerable size, with broad-based, large leaves attached
directly to the stem. In the leaves are a series of numerous
parallel vascular bundles. The wood cells in microscopic
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
section show two rows or more of round bordered
pits. The cones are very large, but the male and female
are different in size and organization. The female cone
is composed of series of simple scales arranged spirally
round the axis, and each scale bears a single seed and a
small ligule.</p>
<p>The pollen grains from the male cone are caught on
the ligule and the pollen tubes enter the micropyle of the
ovule, bringing in passive male cells which may develop
in large numbers in each grain. The seeds when ripe
are stony, and some are provided with a wing from part
of the tissue of the scale. In the ripe cones the scales
separate from the cone axis.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">Abietine&aelig;</span> are woody trees, some reaching a
great height, all with a strong main stem. The leaves
are of two kinds: primary ones borne directly attached
to the stem (as in first-year shoots of the Larch), and
secondary ones borne in tufts of two (in Pine) or a large
number (in older branches of Larch) on special short
branches, the primary leaves only developing as brown
scales closely attached to the stems. Leaves generally
very fine and needlelike, and with a central vascular
bundle. The wood in microscopic section shows a single
row of round bordered pits on the narrow trache&aelig;.</p>
<p>The female cones are large, male and female differing
greatly in size and organization. The female cone, composed
of a spiral series of pairs of scales, which often
fuse together as the cone ripens. Each upper scale of
the pair bears two seeds. The pollen grains from the
male cone enter the micropyle of the seed and are caught
in the tissue (apex of nucellus) there; the pollen tubes
discharge passive male cells, only two of which develop
in each grain. The seeds when ripe are stony and provided
with a wing from the tissue of the scale on which
they were borne.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">Cupresse&aelig;</span> are woody trees reaching no great
height, and of a bushy, branching growth. The leaves
are attached directly to the main stem, and arrange
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
themselves in alternating pairs of very small leaves,
closely pressed to the stem. The wood in microscopic
section shows a single row of round bordered pits
on the trache&aelig;.</p>
<p>The cones are small, and the scales forming them
arranged in cycles. The female scales bear a varying
number of seeds. The pollen grain has two passive
male cells. The seeds when ripe are stony, with wings,
though in some cases (species of Juniper) the cone
scales close up and become fleshy, so that the whole
fruit resembles a berry.</p>
<p>The <span class="sc">Taxe&aelig;</span> are woody, though not great trees,
bushily branched. The leaves are attached spirally all
round the stem, but place themselves so as to appear
to lie in pairs arranged in one horizontal direction.
The wood in microscopic section shows a single row
of round bordered pits on the trache&aelig;.</p>
<p>There are small male cones, but the seeds are not
borne on cones, growing instead on special short axes,
where there may be several young ovules, but on which
usually two seeds ripen. The seeds are big, and have
an inner stone and outer fleshy covering. Some have
special outer fleshy structures known as &ldquo;arils&rdquo;, <i>e.g.</i>
the red outer cup round the yew &ldquo;berry&rdquo; (which is not
a berry at all, but a single unenclosed seed with a fleshy
coat).</p>
<p>When we turn to the <span class="sc">Cordaite&aelig;</span> we come to a
group of plants which bears distinct relationship to the
preceding, but which has a number of individual characters.
It is a group of which we should know nothing
were it not for the fossils preserved in the Pal&aelig;ozoic
rocks; yet, notwithstanding the fact that it flourished
so long ago, it is a family of which we know much.
At the time of the Coal Measures and the succeeding
Permo-carboniferous period, it was of great importance,
and, indeed, in some of the French deposits it would
seem as though whole layers of coal were composed
entirely of its leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Among the fossil remains of this family there are
impressions, casts, and true petrifactions, so that we
know both its external appearance and
the internal anatomy of nearly every
part of several species of the genus.
For a long time the various fossil remains
of the plant were not recognized
as belonging to each other and together
forming the records of one and the
same plant&mdash;the broad, long leaves
with their parallel veins were looked
on as Monocotyledons (see <a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>); the
pith casts (see <a href="#fig63">fig. 63</a>) were thought to
be peculiar constricted stems, and were
called <i>Sternbergia</i>; while the wood,
which was known from its microscopic
structure, was called <i>Araucarioxylon</i>&mdash;but
the careful work of many masters of
fossil botany, whose laborious studies we
cannot describe in detail here, brought
all these fragments together and proved
them to belong to <i>Cordaites</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 61.&mdash;Leaf of <i>Cordaites</i>,
<i>l</i>, attached by its broad base to a Stem, <i>s</i></p>
<p>We now know that <i>Cordaites</i> were
large trees, with strong upright shafts
of wood, to whose branches large simple
leaves were attached. The leaves were
much bigger than those of any living
Gymnosperm, even than those of the
Kauri Pine (a member of the Araucariace&aelig;),
and seem in some species
to have exceeded 3 ft. in length. The
trees branched only at the top of the
main shaft, and with their huge sword-like
leaves must have differed greatly
in appearance from any plant now
living. The leaves had many parallel veins, as can
be seen in <a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>, and were attached by a broad base
directly to the main stem; thus coming closer to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Araucarias than the other groups of Gymnosperms in
their leaf characters.</p>

that they were tough and well protected

greater extent than are most of the

<p>In the stems the pith was much
larger than that in living Gymnosperms
(where the wood is generally very
solid), and it was hollow in older stems,
except for discs of tissue across the
cavity. The internal cast from these
stems has been described before, and is seen in <a href="#fig63">fig. 63</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of these fossils we are
fortunate enough to have the fructifications,
both male and female, in a good
state of preservation. As in other
Gymnosperms, the male and female
cones are separate, but they differed
less from each other in their arrangement
than do those of any of the living
types hitherto mentioned. They can
hardly be described as true cones,
though they had something of that
nature; the seeds seem to be borne on
special short stems, round which are
also sterile scales. In the seed and
the way it is borne perhaps the Cordaite&aelig;
may be compared more nearly
with the Taxe&aelig; than with the other
groups. A seed, not yet ripe, is shown in slightly diagrammatic
form in <a href="#fig64">fig. 64</a>, where the essential details
are illustrated. The seeds of this family sometimes
reached a considerable size, and had a fleshy layer
which was thick in comparison with the stone, and externally
comparable with a cherry&mdash;though, of course, of
very different nature in reality, for <i>Cordaites</i>, like <i>Taxus</i>,
is a Gymnosperm, with simple naked seeds, while a
cherry is the fruit of an Angiosperm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>In a few words, these are the main characters of
the large group of <i>Cordaites</i>, which held the dominant
position among Gymnosperms in the Pal&aelig;ozoic era.
They have relationships, or perhaps one should say
likenesses, to many groups. Their stem- and root-anatomy
is similar to the Conifer&aelig; of the present day,
the position of the ovules is like that in the Taxace&aelig;,
the male cones in some
measure recall those of
<i>Ginkgo</i>, the anatomy of their
leaves has points which are
comparable with those of the
Cycads, to which group also
the large pith in the stem
and the structure of some
details in the seeds unite
them. Their own specially
distinctive characters lie in
their crown of huge leaves,
and unbranched shaft of
stem, the similarity of their
male and female inflorescences,
and some points in
their pollen grains which
have not been mentioned.
The type is a very complex
one, possibly coming near
the stock which, having
branched out in various
directions, gave rise to several of the living families.</p>

<p>Plants which come very near to the Cordaite&aelig; are
the <span class="sc">Poroxyle&aelig;</span>. Of this group we have unfortunately
no remains of fructifications in organic connection, so
that its actual position must remain a little doubtful
till they are discovered. There seems no doubt that
they must have borne seeds.</p>
<p>Still, it has been abundantly demonstrated in recent
years that the anatomy of the root, stem, and leaves
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
indicates with considerable exactness the position of
any plant, so that, as these are known, we can deduce
from them, with a feeling of safety, the position that
<i>Poroxylon</i> takes in the natural system. In its anatomy
the characters are those of the Cordaite&aelig;, with certain
details which show a more primitive nature and seem
to be characteristic of the groups below it in organization.</p>
<p><i>Poroxylon</i> is not common, and until recently had not
been found in the Lower Coal Measures of England.
The plants appear to have been much smaller than
<i>Cordaites</i>, with delicate
stems which bore relatively
large simple leaves. The
anatomy of the root was
that common in Gymnosperms,
but the stem had
a very large pith, and the
leaves were much like those
of <i>Cordaites</i> in having
parallel veins. An important
character in the
anatomy of the stem was
the presence of what is
known as <i>centripetal wood</i>.
This must be shortly explained. In all the stems hitherto
considered, the first-formed wood cells (protoxylems,
see <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>) developed at the central point of the wood,
towards the pith (see <a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>, <i>px</i>, <a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>). This is characteristic
of all Angiosperms and the higher Gymnosperms
(except in a couple of recently investigated
Pines), but among the lower plants we find that part of
the later wood develops to the inner side of these protoxylem
masses. The distinction is shown in <a href="#fig65">fig. 65</a>.</p>

of the centre of the stem.</p>
<p>This point is one to which botanists have given
much attention, and on which they have laid much weight
in considering the affinities of the lower Gymnosperms
and the intermediate groups between them and the ferns,
which are found among the fossils. In <i>Cordaites</i> this
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
point of connection with the lower types is not seen, but
in <i>Poroxylon</i>, which has otherwise a stem anatomy very
similar to <i>Cordaites</i>, we find groups of <i>centripetal</i> wood
developed inside the protoxylem of primary bundles.
For this reason, principally, is <i>Poroxylon</i> of interest at
present, as in its stem anatomy it seems to connect the
<i>Cordaites</i> type with that of the group below it in general
organization.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ginkgoales.</span>&mdash;Reference to <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a> shows that <i>Ginkgo</i>,
the Maidenhair tree, belongs to the Ginkgoales, a group
taking equal rank with the large and complex series of
the Coniferales. The Ginkgoales of the present day,
however, have but one living representative. <i>Ginkgo</i>
stands alone, the single living species of its genus, representing
a family so different from any other living family
that it forms a prime group by itself.</p>
<p>Had the tree not been held sacred in China and
Japan, it is probable that it would long since have been
extinct, for it is now known only in cultivation. It is
indeed a relic from the past which has been fortunately
preserved alive for our examination. It belongs to the
fossil world, as a belated November rose belongs to the
summer.</p>
<p>Because of its beauty and interest the plant is now
widely distributed under cultivation, and is available for
study almost as freely as the other types of living
Gymnosperms already mentioned, so that but a short
summary of its more important features is needed here.</p>
<p>Old plants, such as can be seen growing freely in
Japan (in Kew Gardens there is also a fine specimen),
are very tall handsome woody trees, with noble shafts
and many branches. The leaves grow on little side
shoots and are the most characteristic external feature of
the tree; their living form is illustrated in <a href="#fig66">fig. 66</a>, which
shows the typical simple shape as well as the lobed form
of the leaf which are to be found, with all intermediate
stages, on the same tree. No other plant (save a
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
few ferns, which can generally be distinguished from it
without difficulty) has leaves at all like these, so that it
is particularly easy to identify the fossil remains, of which
there are many.</p>

<p>The wood is compact and fine grained, the rings of
secondary tissue being developed from a normal cambium
as in the case of the higher
Gymnosperms, and the individual
trache&aelig; have round bordered
pits. There are small male cones,
but the seeds are not borne in
cones. They develop on special
stalks on which are no scales,
but a small mass of tissue at the
base of the seed called the
&ldquo;collar&rdquo;. Usually there are two
young ovules, of which often only
one ripens to a fleshy seed, though both may mature.</p>

<p>The ripe seed reaches the size shown in the diagram,
and is orange coloured and very fleshy; within it is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
stone encasing the endosperm, which is large, <i>green</i>, and
starchy, and contains the embryo with two cotyledons.
This embryo is small compared with the endosperm,
cf. <a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>, <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>, which is somewhat similar to that of
<i>Ginkgo</i> in this stage.</p>
<p>Of the microscopic characters of the reproductive
organs the most remarkable is the male cell. This is
not a passive nucleus, as in the plants hitherto considered,
but is an <i>actively swimming</i> cell of some size,
provided with a spiral of cilia
(hairlike structures) whose
movements propel it through
the water. In the cavity of
the unripe seed these swim
towards the female cell, and
actively penetrate it. The
arrangements of the seed are
diagrammatically shown in
<a href="#fig68">fig. 68</a>, which should be compared
with that of <i>Cycas</i>, <a href="#fig76">fig. 76</a>,
with which it has many
points in common.</p>

<p>The nature of the male
cell in <i>Cordaites</i> is not yet
known, but there is reason
to suspect it may have been
actively swimming also. As
this is uncertain, however,
we may consider <i>Ginkgo</i> the most highly organized plant
which has such a primitive feature, a feature which is a
bond of union between it and the ferns, and which, when
it was discovered about a dozen years ago, caused a
considerable sensation in the botanical world.</p>
<p>To turn now to the fossil records of this family.
Leaf impressions of <i>Ginkgo</i> are found in rocks of nearly
all ages back even to the Upper Pal&aelig;ozoic. They show
a considerable variety of form, and it is certain that they
do not all belong to the same <i>species</i> as the living plant,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
but probably they are closely allied. <a href="#fig69">Fig. 69</a> shows a
typical impression from the Lower Mesozoic rocks. In
this specimen, the cells of the epidermis were fortunately
sufficiently well preserved to be seen with the microscope,
and there is a distinct difference in
the size and shape of the cells of
living and fossil species, see <a href="#fig70">fig. 70</a>;
but this difference is slight as compared
with the great similarity of
form and appearance, as can be seen
on comparing figs. <a href="#fig69">69</a> and <a href="#fig66">66</a>, <span class="small">B</span>, so
that the fossil is at the most a different
species of the genus <i>Ginkgo</i>.
Among the fossil leaves there is
greater variety than among the
living ones, and some which are very
deeply lobed so as to form a divided
palm-like leaf go by different names, e.g. <i>Baiera</i>, but
they are supposed to belong to the same family. Fossil
seeds and male cones are also known as impressions,
and are found far back in the
Mesozoic rocks. From the
fossil impressions it is certain
that <i>Ginkgo</i> and plants closely
allied to it were very widespread
in the past, as they are
found all over Europe as well
as the other continents. Particularly
in the Lower Mesozoic
rocks <i>Ginkgo</i> seems to
have been a world-wide type
growing in great abundance.</p>

<p>In the Pal&aelig;ozoic the
records are not so undoubted,
but there is strong evidence
which leads us to suppose that if the genus now living
were not then extant, at least other closely related
genera were, and there seems to be good grounds for
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
supposing that <i>Ginkgo</i> and <i>Cordaites</i> may have both
arisen from some ancient common stock.</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">III. The Bennettitales</span></h2>
<p>This fascinating family is known only from the
fossils, and is so remote in its organization from any
common living forms that it may perhaps be a little difficult
for those who do not know the Cycads to appreciate
the position of Bennettites. It would probably be
better for one studying fossil plants for the first time
to read the chapters on the Cycads, Pteridosperms, and
Ferns before this chapter on the present group, which
has characters connecting it with that series.</p>
<p>Until recently the bulk of the fossils which are found
as impressions of stems and foliage of this family were
very naturally classed as Cycads. They are extremely
common in the Mesozoic rocks (the so-called Age of
Cycads), and in the external appearance of both stems
and leaves they are practically identical with the Cycads.</p>
<p>A few incomplete fructifications of some species have
been known in Europe for many years, but it is only
recently that they have been fully known. This is owing
to Wieland&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
work on the American species, which has
made known the complete organization of the fructifications
from a mass of rich and well-petrified material.</p>
<p>In the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic rocks
of America these plants abound, with their microscopic
structure well preserved, and their fructifications show
an organization of a different nature from that of any
past or present Cycad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Probably owing to their external appearance, Wieland
describes the plants as &ldquo;Cycads&rdquo; in the title of his big
book on them; but the generic name he uses, <i>Cycadeoidea</i>,
seems less known in this country than the equally
well-established name of <i>Bennettites</i>, which has long
been used to denote the European specimens of this
family, and which will be used in the following short
account of the group.</p>
<p>At the present time no family of fossils is exciting
more interest. Their completely Cycadean appearance
and their unique type of fructification have led many
botanists to see in them the forerunners of the Angiosperms,
to look on them as the key to that mystery&mdash;the
origin of the flowering plants. This position will be
discussed and the many facts in its favour noted, but we
must not forget that the <i>Bennettitales</i> have only recently
been realized fully by botanists, and that a new toy is
ever particularly charming, a new cure particularly efficacious,
and a new theory all-persuasive.</p>
<p>From their detailed study of the flowering plants
botanists have leaned toward different groups as the
present representatives of the primitive types. The
various claims of the different families to this position
cannot be considered here; probably that of the Ranales
(the group of families round Ranunculace&aelig; as a central
type) is the best supported. Yet these plants are most
frequently delicate herbs, which would have stood relatively
less chance of fossilization than the other families
which may be considered primitive. They are peculiarly
remote from the group of Bennettite&aelig; in their
vegetative structure, a fact the importance of which
seems to have been underrated, for in the same breath
we are assured that the Bennettites are a kind of cousin
to the ancient Angiosperms, and that the Ranales are
among the most primitive living Angiosperms, and therefore
presumably nearest the ancient ones.</p>
<p>However, let us leave the charms of controversy on
one side and look at the actual structure of the group.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
They were widely spread in Lower Mesozoic times, the
plants being preserved as casts, impressions, and with
structure in great numbers. The bulk of the described
structural specimens have been obtained from the rocks
of England, France, Italy, and America, although leaf
impressions are almost universally known. The genus
<i>Williamsonia</i> belongs to this family, and is one of the
best known of Mesozoic plant impressions.</p>
<p>Externally the Bennettite&aelig; were
identical in appearance with stumpy
Cycads, and their leaves it is which
gave rise to the surmise, so long prevalent,
that the Lower Mesozoic was
the &ldquo;Age of Cycads&rdquo;, just as it was
the Pteridosperm leaves that gave the
Pal&aelig;ozoic the credit of being the
&ldquo;Age of Ferns&rdquo;. In the anatomy of
both stem and leaf, also, the characters
are entirely Cycadean; the outgoing
leaf trace is indeed simpler in its
course than that of the Cycads.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig71">
<img src="images/fig71.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="631" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 71.&mdash;Half of a Longitudinal
Section through a Mature Cone of <i>Bennettites</i></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="small">A</span>, Short conical axis; <i>s</i>, enclosing bracts; <span class="small">S</span>,
seeds; <i>sc</i>, sterile scales between the seeds.</p>
<p>The fructifications, however, differ
fundamentally from those of the Cycads,
as indeed they do from those of
any known family. They took the
form of compact cones, which occurred
in very large numbers in the mature
plants hidden by the leaf bases. In <i>Williamsonia</i>, of
which we know much less detail, the fructifications stood
away from the main axis on long pedicels.</p>
<p>In <i>Bennettites</i> the cones were composed of series of
sheathing scales surrounding a short conical axis on
which stood thin radiating stalks, each bearing a seed.
Between them were long-stalked sterile scales with expanded
ends. A part of a cone is illustrated diagrammatically
in <a href="#fig71">fig. 71</a>. The whole had much the appearance
of a complex fruit. In some specimens these
features alone are present in the cones, but in younger
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
cones from the American plants further structures are
found attached. Below the main axis of the seed-bearing
part of the cone was a series of large complex leaflike
structures closely resembling fern leaves in their
much-divided nature. On the pinn&aelig; of these leaves
were crowded innumerable large sporangia, similar to
those of a fern, which provided the pollen grains. The
fossils are particularly well preserved, and have been
found with these male (pollen-bearing) organs in the
young unopened stages, and also in the mature unfolded
condition, as well as the ripening seed cones from which
they have faded, just as the stamens fade from a flower
when the seeds enlarge.</p>

complex leaves with pollen sacs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>It appears that these huge complex leaflike structures
were really stamens, but nevertheless they were
rolled up in the circinate form as are young fern leaves,
and as they unrolled and spread out round the central
cone they must have had the appearance of a whorl of
leaves (see <a href="#fig72">fig. 72</a>).</p>
<p>This, in a few words, is the main general character
of the fructification. The most important features, on
which stress is laid, are the following. The association
of the male and female structures on the same axis, with
the female part <i>above</i> the male. This arrangement is
found only in the flowering
plants; the lower plants,
which have male and female
on the same cone, have them
mixed, or the female below,
and are in any case much
simpler in their entire organization.
The conical form
of the axis is also important,
as is the fact that it terminates
in the seed-bearing
structures.</p>

<i>Bennettites</i>, Seed, with Embryo</p>
<p class="caption"><i>c</i>, Double-layered seed coat; <i>n</i>, crushed
nucellus; <i>cot.</i>, two cotyledons which
practically fill the seed.</p>
<p>The position of the individual seeds, each on the end
of a single stalk, is remarkable, as are the long-stalked
bracts whose shield-like ends join in the protection of
the seeds. These structures together give the cone
much of the appearance of a complex fruit of a flowering
plant, but the structure of the seeds themselves is
that of a simple Gymnosperm.</p>
<p>In the seeds, however, was an <i>embryo</i>. In this they
differ from all known seeds of an earlier date, which, as
has been already noted (see <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>), are always devoid of
one. This embryo is one of the most important features
of the plant. It had two cotyledons which filled the
seed space (see <a href="#fig73">fig. 73</a>), and left almost no trace of the
endosperm. Reference to <a href="#Page_112">p. 112</a> will show that this is
an advance on the Cycad seed, which has a small embryo
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
embedded in a large mass of endosperm, and that
it practically coincides with the Dicotyledonous type.</p>
<p>The seed with its embryo suggested comparison with
the Angiosperms long before the complete structure of
the fructification was known.</p>
<p>The fern-like nature of the pollen-bearing structures
is another very important point. Were any one of these
leaflike &ldquo;stamens&rdquo; found isolated its fern-like nature
would not have been questioned a year or two ago,
and their presence in the &ldquo;flower&rdquo; of <i>Bennettites</i> is a
strong argument in favour of the Fern-Pteridosperm
affinities of the group.</p>
<p>Had the parts of this remarkable fructification developed
on separate trees, or on separate branches or distinct
cones of the same one, they would have been much
less suggestive than they are at present, and the fructifications
might well have been included among those of
the Gymnosperms, differing little more (apart from the
embryo) from the other Gymnosperm genera than they
do from each other. In fact, the extremely fern-like
nature of the male organs is almost more suggestive of
a Pteridosperm affinity, for even the simplest Cycads
have well-marked scaly cones as their male organs.
The female cone, again, considered as an isolated structure,
can be interpreted as being not vitally different
from <i>Cordaites</i>, where the seeds are borne on special
short stalks amidst scales.</p>
<p>The embryo would, in any case, point to a position
among advanced types; but it is so common for one
organ of a plant to evolve along lines of its own independently,
or in advance of the other organs, that
the embryo structure alone could not have been held
to counterbalance the Cycadean stems and leaves, the
Pteridosperm-like male organs, and the Gymnospermic
seeds.</p>
<p>But all these parts occur on the same axis, arranged
in the manner typical of Angiosperms. The seed-bearing
structures at the apex, the &ldquo;stamens&rdquo; below them, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a series of expanded scales below these again, which it
takes little imagination to picture as incipient petals and
sepals; and behold&mdash;the thing is a flower!</p>
<p>And being a &ldquo;flower&rdquo;, is in closest connection with
the ancestors of the modern flowering plants, which must
consequently have evolved from some Cycadean-like
ancestor which also gave rise to the Bennettitales. Thus
can the flowering plants be linked on to the series that
runs through the Cycads directly to the primitive ferns!</p>
<p>It is evident that this group, of all those known
among the fossils, comes most closely to an approximation
of Angiospermic structure and arrangement.
Enough has been said to show that in their actual
nature they are not Angiosperms, though they have
some of their characters, while at the same time they are
not Cycads, though they have their appearance. They
stand somewhere between the two. Though many
botanists at present hold that this mixture of characters
indicates a relationship equivalent to a kind of cousinship
with the Angiosperms, and both groups may be
supposed to have originated from a Cycadean stock, this
theory has not yet stood the test of time, nor is it supported
by other evidence from the fossils. We will go
so far as to say that it appears as though <i>some</i> Angiosperms
arose in that way; but flowering plants show so
many points utterly differing from the whole Cycadean
stock that a little scepticism may not be unwholesome.</p>
<p>It is well to remember the Lycopods, where (as we
shall see, <a href="#Page_141">p. 141</a>) structures very like seeds were developed
at the time when the Lycopods were the dominant
plants, and we do not find any evidence to prove that
they led on to the main line of seed plants. Similarly,
Cycads may have got what practically amounted to
flowers at the time when they were the dominant group,
and it is very conceivable that they did not lead on to
the main line of flowering plants.</p>
<p>Whatever view may be held, however, and whatever
may be the future discoveries relating to this group of
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
plants, we can see in the Bennettitales points which
throw much light on the potentialities of the Cycadean
stock, and structures which have given rise to some most
interesting speculations on the subject of the Angiosperms.
This group is another of the jewels in the crown of
fossil botany, for the whole of its structures have been
reconstructed from the stones that hold all that remains
of this once extensive and now extinct family of plants.</p>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">IV. The Cycads</span></h2>
<p>The group of the <i>Cycadales</i>, which has a systematic
value equivalent to the <i>Ginkgoales</i>, contains a much
larger variety of genera and species than does the latter.
There are still living nine genera, with more than a
hundred and fifty species, which form (though a small
one compared with most of the prime groups) a well-defined
family. They are the most primitive Gymnosperms,
the most primitive seed-bearing plants now
living, and in their appearance and characters are very
different from any other modern type. Their external
resemblance to the group of the Bennettitales, however,
is very striking, and indeed, without the fructifications
it would be impossible to distinguish them.</p>
<p>The best known of the genera is that of <i>Cycas</i>, of
which an illustration is given in <a href="#fig74">fig. 74</a>. The thick,
stumpy stem and crown of &ldquo;palm&rdquo;-like leaves give it
a very different appearance from any other Gymnosperm.
Commonly the plants reach only a few feet in height,
but very old specimens may grow to the height of 30 ft.
or more. The other genera are smaller, and some have
short stems and a very fern-like appearance, as, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
example, the genus <i>Stangeria</i>, which was supposed
to be a fern when it was first discovered and before
fruiting specimens had been seen.</p>
<p>The large compound leaves are all borne directly on
the main stem, generally in a single rosette at its apex,
and as they die off they leave their fleshy leaf bases,
which cover the stem and remain for an almost indefinite
number of
years.</p>
<p>The wood of the main trunks differs from that of the other Gymnosperms
in being very loosely built, with a large pith and much soft
tissue between the radiating bands of wood. There is a cambium which adds
zones of secondary tissue, but it does not do its work regularly, and the
cross section of an old Cycad stem shows disconnected
rings of wood, accompanied by much soft tissue. The cells of the wood
have bordered pits on their walls, and in the main axis
the wood is usually all developed in a centrifugal direction,
but in the axis of the cones some centripetal wood
is found (refer to <i>c</i>, <a href="#fig65">fig. 65</a>, <a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>).</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 74.&mdash;Plant of <i>Cycas</i>, showing the main stem with
the crown of leaves and the irregular branches which come on an old plant</p>
<p>In their fructifications the Cycads stand even further
apart from the rest of the Gymnosperms. One striking
point is the enormous size of their <i>male</i> cones. The
male cones consist of a stout axis, round which are spiral
series of closely packed simple scales covered with pollen-bearing
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
sacs (which bear no inconsiderable likeness to
fern sporangia), the whole cone reaching 1&frac12; ft. in length
in some genera, and weighing several pounds. All the
other Gymnosperms, except the Araucare&aelig;, where they
are an inch or two long, have male cones but a fraction
of an inch in length.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 75.&mdash;Seed-bearing Scale of <i>Cycas</i>, showing its lobed and leaflike character</p>
<p class="caption"><i>s</i>, Seeds attached on either side below the divisions of the sporophyll.</p>
<p>In all the members of the family,
excepting <i>Cycas</i> itself, the female
fructifications also consist of similarly
organized cones bearing a couple of
seeds on each scale instead of the
numerous pollen sacs. In <i>Cycas</i> the
male cones are like those of the other
genera, and reach an enormous size;
but there are no female cones, for the
seeds are borne on special leaflike
scales. These are illustrated in <a href="#fig75">fig. 75</a>,
which shows also that there are
not two seeds (as in the other genera
with cones) to each scale, but an
indefinite number.</p>
<p>The leafy nature of the seed-bearing
scale is an important and interesting
feature. Although theoretically
botanists are accustomed to
accept the view that seeds are always
borne on specially modified leaves (so
that to a botanist even the &ldquo;shell&rdquo;
of a pea-pod and the box of a poppy
capsule are leaves), yet in <i>Cycas</i> alone among living
plants are seeds really found growing on a large structure
which has the appearance of a leaf. Hence, from
this point of view (see <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>, however, for a caution
against concluding that the whole plant is similarly lowly
organized), <i>Cycas</i> is the most primitive of all the living
plants that bear seeds, and hence presumably the likest
to the fossil ancestors of the seed-bearing types. In this
character it is more primitive than the fossil group of
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the <i>Cordaite&aelig;</i>, and comes very close to an intermediate
group of fossils to be considered in the next chapter.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig76">

<span class="small">S</span>, &ldquo;spore&rdquo;, filled with endosperm, in
which lies the embryo <i>e</i>.</p>
<p>To enter into the detailed anatomy of the seeds
would lead us too far into the realms of the specialist,
but we must notice one or two points about them.
Firstly, their very large size, for ripe seeds of <i>Cycas</i> are
as large as peaches (and peaches, it is to be noted, are
fruits, not seeds), and particularly the large size they
attain <i>before</i> they are fertilized
and have an embryo.
Among the higher plants
the young seeds remain very
minute until an embryo is
secured by the act of fertilization,
but in the Cycads
the seeds enlarge and lay
in a big store of starch in
the endosperm before the
embryo appears, so that in
the cases in which fertilization
is prevented large,
sterile &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; are nevertheless
produced. This
must be looked on as a
want of precision in the
mechanism, and as a wasteful
arrangement which is undeniably primitive. An even
more wasteful arrangement appears to have been common
to the &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; of the Pal&aelig;ozoic period, for, though
many fossil &ldquo;seeds&rdquo; are known in detail from the old
rocks, not one is known to have any trace of an embryo.
A general plan of the <i>Cycas</i> seed is shown in <a href="#fig76">fig. 76</a>,
which should be compared with that of <i>Ginkgo</i> (<a href="#fig68">fig. 68</a>).
The large size of the endosperm and the thick and
complex seed-coats are characteristic features of both
these structures. Another point that makes the Cycad
seeds of special interest is the fact that the male cells
(as in <i>Ginkgo</i>) are developed as active, free-swimming
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
sperms, which swim towards the female cell in the space
provided for them in the seed (see <i>p.c</i>, <a href="#fig76">fig. 76</a>).</p>
<p>The characters of the Cycads as they are now
living prove them to be an extremely primitive group,
and therefore presumably well represented among the
fossils; and indeed among the Mesozoic rocks there is
no lack of impressions which have been described as the
leaves of Cycads. There is, however, very little reliable
material, and practically none which shows good microscopic
structure. Leaf impressions alone are most unsafe&mdash;more
unsafe in this group, perhaps, than in any
other&mdash;for reasons that will be apparent later on, and
the conclusions that used to be drawn about the vast
number of Cycads which inhabited the globe in the early
Mesozoic must be looked on with caution, resulting from
the experience of recent discoveries proving many of
these leaves to belong to a different family.</p>
<p>There remain, however, many authentic specimens
which show that <i>Cycas</i> certainly goes back very far in
history, and specimens of this genus are known from
the older Mesozoic rocks. We cannot say, however, as
securely as used to be said, that the Mesozoic was the
&ldquo;Age of Cycads&rdquo;, although it was doubtless the age of
plants which had much of the external appearance of
Cycads.</p>
<p>From the Pal&aelig;ozoic we have no reliable evidence of
the existence of Cycads, though the plants of that time
included a group which has an undoubted connection
with them.</p>
<p>Indeed, so far as fossil evidence goes, we must suppose
that the Cycads, since their appearance, possibly at
the close of the Pal&aelig;ozoic, have never been a dominant
or very extensive family, though they grew in the past
all over the world, and in Europe seem to have remained
till the middle of the Tertiary epoch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">V. Pteridosperms</span></h2>
<p>This group consists entirely of plants which are extinct,
and which were in the height of their development
in the Coal Measure period. As a group they are the
most recently discovered in the plant world, and but a
few years ago the name &ldquo;Pteridosperm&rdquo; was unknown.
They form, however, both one of the most interesting
of plant families and one of the most numerous of those
which flourished in the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>To mention first the vital point of interest in their
structure, they show <i>leaves which in all respects appear
like ordinary foliage leaves, and yet bear seeds</i>. These
leaves, which we now know bore the seeds, had long
been considered as typical fern leaves, and had been
named and described as fern leaves. There are two
extremely important results from the discovery of this
fossil group, viz. that leaves, to all appearance like
ordinary foliage, can directly bear seeds, and that the
leaves, though like fern leaves, bore seeds like those
of a Cycad.</p>
<p>As the name <i>Pteridosperm</i> indicates, the group is a
link between the ferns and the seed-bearing plants, and
as such is of special interest and value to botanists.</p>
<p>The gradual recognition of this group from among
the numerous plant fragments of Pal&aelig;ozoic age is one
of the most interesting of the accumulative discoveries
of fossil botany. Ever since fossil remains attracted the
attention of enquiring minds many &ldquo;ferns&rdquo; have been
recognized among the rich impressions of the Coal
Measures. Most of them, however, were not connected
with any structural material, and were given many different
names of specific value. So numerous were these
fern &ldquo;species&rdquo; that it was supposed that in the Coal
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Measure period the ferns must have been the dominant
class, and it is often spoken of even yet as the &ldquo;Age of
Ferns&rdquo;. From the rocks of the same age, preserved
with their microscopical structure perfect, were stems
which were called <i>Lyginodendron</i>. In the coal balls
associated with these stems (which were the commonest
of the stems so preserved) were also roots, petioles, and
leaflets, but they were isolated, like the most of the
fragments in a coal ball, and to each was given its name,
with no thought of the various fragments having any
connection with each other. Gradually, however, various
fragments from the coal balls had been recognized as
belonging together; one specimen of a petiole attached
to a stem sufficed to prove that all the scattered petioles
of the same type belonged also to that kind of stem, and
when leaves were found attached to an isolated fragment
of the petiole, the chain of proof was complete that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
leaves belonged to the stem, and so on. By a series of
lengthy and painstaking investigations all the parts of
the plant now called <i>Lyginodendron</i> have been brought
together, and the impressions of its leaves have been
connected with it, these being of the fernlike type so
long called <i>Sphenopteris</i>, illustrated in <a href="#fig77">fig. 77</a>.</p>

bordered pits.</p>
<p>The anatomy of the main stem is very suggestive
of that of a Cycad. The zones of secondary wood are
loosely built, the quantity of soft tissue between the
radiating bands of wood, and the size of the pith being
large, while from the main axis double strands of wood
run out to the leaf base. The primary bundles, however,
are not like those of a Cycad stem, but have groups
of <i>centripetal</i> wood within the protoxylem, and thus
resemble the primary bundles of <i>Poroxylon</i> (see <a href="#Page_97">p. 97</a>),
which are more primitive in this respect than those of
the Cycads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The roots of <i>Lyginodendron</i>, when young, were like
those of the Marattiaceous ferns, their five-rayed mass
of wood being characteristic of that family, and different
from the type of root found in most other ferns (cf. <a href="#fig78b">fig. 78<span class="small">B</span></a>
with <a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a> on <a href="#Page_60">p. 60</a>). Unlike fern roots of any kind,
however, they have well-developed zones of secondary
wood, in which they approach the Gymnospermic roots
(see <a href="#fig78b">fig. 78<span class="small">B</span></a>, <i>s</i>).</p>

<p class="caption"><i>w</i>, Five-rayed mass of primary wood; <i>s</i>, zone of secondary wood; <i>c</i>, cortical
and other soft tissues.</p>
<p>A further mixture of characters is seen in the vascular
bundles of the petioles. A double strand, like that in
the lower Gymnosperms, goes off to the leaf base from
the main axis, but in the petiole itself the bundle is like
a normal fern stele, and shows no characters in transverse
section which would separate it from the ferns. Such a
petiole is illustrated in <a href="#fig79">fig. 79</a>, with its <b>V</b>-shaped fernlike
stele. On the petioles and stems were certain rough,
spiny structures of the nature of complex hairs. In some
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
cases they are glandular, as is seen in <i>g</i> in <a href="#fig79">fig. 79</a>, and
as they seem to be unique in their appearance they have
been of great service in the identification of the various
isolated organs of the plant.</p>
<p>As is seen from <a href="#fig77">fig. 77</a>, the leaves were quite fern-like,
but in structural specimens they have been found
with the characteristic glandular hairs of the plant.</p>
<p>The seeds were
so long known under
the name of <i>Lagenostoma</i>
that they are
still called by it,
though they have
been identified as
belonging to <i>Lyginodendron</i>.
They were
small (about &frac14; in.
in maximum length)
when compared with
those of most other
plants of the group,
or of the Cycads,
with which they show
considerable affinity.
They are too complex
to describe fully,
and have been mentioned
already (see
<a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>), so that they will not be described in much detail
here. The diagrammatic figure (<a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>) shows the
essential characters of their longitudinal section, and
their transverse section, as illustrated in <a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>, shows
the complex and elaborate mechanism of the apex.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>v</i>, Fern-like stele; <i>c</i>, cortex; <i>g</i>, glandular hairlike protuberances.</p>
<p>Round the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; was a sheath, something like the
husk round a hazel nut, which appears to have had
the function of a protective organ, though what its real
morphological nature may have been is as yet an unsolved
problem. On the sheath were glandular hairs
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
like those found on the petiole and leaves, which were,
indeed, the first clues that led to the discovery of the
connection between the seed and the plant <i>Lyginodendron</i>.</p>
<p>The pollen grains seem to have been produced in
sacs very like fern sporangia developed on normal
foliage leaves, each grain entered the cavity <i>pc</i> in the
seed (see <a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>), but of the
nature of the male cell we are
ignorant. In none of the
fossils has any embryo been
found in the &ldquo;seeds&rdquo;, so that
presumably they ripened, or
at least matured their tissues,
before fertilization.</p>
<p>These, in a few words,
are the essentials of the structures
of <i>Lyginodendron</i>. But
this plant is only one of a
group, and at least two other
of the Pteridosperms deserve
notice, viz. <i>Medullosa</i>, which
is more complex, and <i>Heterangium</i>,
which is simpler than
the central type.</p>

<p><i>Heterangium</i> is found also
in rocks rather older than the
coal series of England, though of Carboniferous age,
viz. in the Calciferous sandstone series of Scotland, it
occurs also in the ordinary Coal Measure nodules. It
is in several respects more primitive than <i>Lyginodendron</i>,
and in particular in the structure of its stele
comes nearer to that of ferns. The stele is, in fact,
a solid mass of primary wood and wood parenchyma,
corresponding in some degree to the protostele of a
simple type (see <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>, <a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>), but it has towards the
outside groups of protoxylem surrounded by wood in
both centripetal and centrifugal directions, which are
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
just like the primary bundles in <i>Lyginodendron</i>. Outside
the primary mass of wood is a zone of secondary
wood, but the quantity is not large in proportion to it
(see <a href="#fig81">fig. 81</a>), as is common in Lyginodendron.</p>
<p>Though the primary mass is so fernlike in appearance
the larger tracheids show series of bordered pits, as do
most of the tracheids of the Pteridosperms, in which
they show a Gymnosperm-like character.</p>

<p>The foliage of <i>Heterangium</i> was fernlike, with much-divided
leaves similar to those of <i>Lyginodendron</i>. We
have reason to suspect, though actual proof is wanting
as yet, that small Gymnosperm-like seeds were borne
directly on these leaves.</p>
<p><i>Medullosa</i> has been mentioned already (see <a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>)
because of the interesting and unusually complex type of
its vascular anatomy. Each individual stele of the
group of three in the stem, however, is essentially
similar to the stele of a Heterangium.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Though the whole arrangement appears to differ
so widely from other stems in the plant world, careful
comparison with young stages of recent Cycads has
indicated a possible remote connection with that group,
while in the primary arrangements of the protosteles a
likeness may be traced to the
ferns. The roots, even in their
primary tissues, were like those
of Gymnosperms, but the foliage
with its compound leaves was
quite fern-like externally. A
small part of a leaf is shown in
<a href="#fig83">fig. 83</a>, and is clearly like a fern
in superficial appearance. The
leaves were large, and the leaf
bases strong and well supplied
with very numerous branching
vascular bundles.</p>

<p>The connection between this plant and certain large
three-ribbed seeds known as <i>Trigonocarpus</i> is strongly
suspected, though actual continuity is not yet established
in any of the specimens hitherto discovered. These
seeds have been mentioned before (<a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a> and <a href="#Page_82">p. 82</a>).
They were larger than the other fossil seeds which we
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
have mentioned, and, with their fleshy coat, were similar
in general organization to the Cycads, though the fact
that the seed coat stood free from the inner tissues right
down to the base seems to mark them as being more
primitive (cf. <a href="#fig55">fig. 55</a>, <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>).</p>
<p>Of impressions of the Pteridosperms the most striking
is, perhaps, the foliage known as
<i>Neuropteris</i> (see <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>, <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>), to
which the large seeds are found
actually attached (cf. <a href="#fig85">fig. 85</a>).</p>

<p>Ever-increasing numbers of the &ldquo;ferns&rdquo; are being
recognized as belonging to the Pteridosperms, but
<i>Heterangium</i>, <i>Lyginodendron</i>, and <i>Medullosa</i> form the
three principal genera, and are in themselves a series
indicating the connection between the fernlike and Cycadean
characters.</p>
<p>Before the fructifications were suspected of being
seeds the anatomy of these plants was known, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
their nature was partly recognized from it alone, though
at that time they were supposed to have only fernlike
spores.</p>
<p>The very numerous impressions of their fernlike
foliage from the Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks indicate that the plants
which bore such leaves must have existed at that time
in great quantity. They must have been, in fact, one
of the dominant types of the vegetation of the period.
The recent discovery that so large a proportion of them
were not ferns, but were seed-bearing plants, alters the
long-established belief that the ferns reached their high-water
mark of prosperity in the Coal Measure period.
Indeed, the fossils of this age which remain undoubtedly
true ferns are far from numerous. It is the seed-bearing
Pteridosperms which had their day in Pal&aelig;ozoic times.
Whether they led directly on to the Cycads is as yet
uncertain, the probability being rather that they and the
Cycads sprang from a common stock which had in some
measure the tendencies of both groups.</p>
<p>That the Pteridosperms in themselves combined
many of the most important features of both Ferns and
Gymnosperms is illustrated in the account of them given
above, which may be summarized as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus it can be seen at a glance, without entering
into minuti&aelig;, that the characters are divided between
the two groups with approximate equality. The connection
with Ferns is clear, and the connection with
Gymnosperms is clear. The point which is not yet determined,
and about which discussion will probably long
rage, is the position of this group in the whole scheme
of the plant world. Do they stand as a connecting link
between the ferns on one hand and the whole train of
higher plants on the other, or do they lead so far as the
Cycads and there stop?</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">VI. The Ferns</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately the records in the rocks do not go
back so far as to touch what must have been the most
interesting period in the history of the ferns, namely,
the point where they diverged from some simple ancestral
type, or at least were sufficiently primitive to
give indications of their origin from some lower group.</p>
<p>Before the Devonian period all plant impressions
are of little value, and by that early pre-Carboniferous
time there are preserved complex leaves, which are to
all appearance highly organized ferns.</p>
<p>To-day the dominant family in this group is the
<i>Polypodiace&aelig;</i>. It includes nearly all our British ferns,
and the majority of species for the whole world. This
family does not appear to be very old, however, and
it cannot be recognized with certainty beyond Mesozoic
times.</p>
<p>From the later Mesozoic we have only material in
the form of impressions, from which it is impossible to
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
draw accurate conclusions unless the specimens have
sporangia attached to them, and this is not often the
case. The cuticle of the epidermis or the spores can
sometimes be studied under the microscope after special
treatment, but on the whole we have very little information
about the later Mesozoic ferns.</p>
<p>A couple of specimens from the older Mesozoic have
been recently described, with well-preserved structure,
and they belong to the family of the Osmundas (the so-called
&ldquo;flowering ferns&rdquo;, because of the appearance of
special leaves on which all the sporangia are crowded),
and show in the anatomical characters of their stems
indications that they may be related to an old group,
the <i>Botryopteride&aelig;</i>, in which are the most important of
the Pal&aelig;ozoic ferns.</p>
<p>In the Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks there are numerous impressions
as well as fern petrifactions, but in the majority
of cases the connection between the two is not yet
established. There were two main series of ferns,
which may be classed as belonging to</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I. Marattiace&aelig;.</p>
<p class="t0">II. Botryopteride&aelig;.</p>
</div>
<p>Of these the former has still living representatives,
though the group is small and unimportant compared
with what it once was; the latter is entirely extinct,
and is chiefly developed in the Carboniferous and succeeding
Permian periods.</p>
<p>The latter group is also the more interesting, for
its members show great variety, and series may be
made of them which seem to indicate the course taken
in the advance towards the Pteridosperm type. For
this reason the group will be considered first, while the
structure of the Pteridosperms is still fresh in our
minds.</p>
<p>The Botryopteride&aelig; formed an extensive and elaborate
family, with its numerous members of different
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
degrees of complexity. There is, unfortunately, but
little known as to their external appearance, and almost
no definite information about their foliage. They are
principally known by the anatomy of their stems and
petioles. Some of them had upright
trunks like small tree ferns (living tree
ferns belong to quite a different family,
however), others appear to have had
underground stems, and many were
slender climbers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig86">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 86.&mdash;Stele of <i>Asterochlaena</i>, showing its
deeply lobed nature</p>
<p>In their anatomy all the members
of the family have monostelic structure
(see <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>). This is noteworthy,
for at the present time though a
number of genera are monostelic, no
family whose members reach any considerable size or
steady growth is exclusively monostelic. In the shape
of the single stele, there is much variety in the different
genera, some having it so deeply lobed that only a careful
examination enables one to recognize its essentially
monostelic nature. In <a href="#fig86">fig. 86</a> a radiating star-shaped
type is illustrated. Between this elaborate type of protostele in <i>Asterochlaena</i>,
and the simple solid circular mass seen in <i>Botryopteris</i>
itself (<a href="#fig88">fig. 88</a>) are all possible gradations of structure.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig87">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 87.&mdash;The Stele of a Botryopteridean
Stem, showing soft tissue in the centre of the
solid wood of the protostele. (Microphoto.)</p>
<p>In several of the genera
the centre of the wood is
not entirely solid, but has cells of soft tissue, an incipient
pith, mixed with scattered tracheids, as in <a href="#fig87">fig. 87</a>.</p>
<p>In most of the genera numerous petioles are given
off from the main axis, and these are often of a large
size compared with it, and may sometimes be thicker
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
than the axis itself. Together with the petiole usually
come off adventitious roots, as is seen in <a href="#fig88">fig. 88</a>, which
shows the main axis of a <i>Botryopteris</i>. The petioles of
the group show much
variety in their structure,
and some are
extremely complex.
A few of the shapes
assumed by the steles
of the petioles are
seen in <a href="#fig89">fig. 89</a>; they
are not divided into
separate bundles in
any of the known
forms, as are many
of the petiole steles
of other families.</p>

<p>In one genus of the family secondary wood has been observed.
This is highly suggestive of the condition of
the stele in <i>Heterangium</i>, where the large mass of the
primary wood is surrounded by a relatively small quantity
of secondary thickening, developed in normal radial
rows from a cambium.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy point in the wood of these plants
is the thickening of the walls of the wood cells. Many
of them have several rows of bordered pits, and are,
individually, practically indistinguishable from those of
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
the Pteridosperms, cf. <a href="#fig81">fig. 81</a> and <a href="#fig90">fig. 90</a>. These are
unlike the characteristic wood cells of modern ferns and
of the other family of Pal&aelig;ozoic ferns.</p>
<p>The foliage of most members of the family is unknown,
or at least, of the many impressions which
possibly belong to the different genera, the most part
have not yet been connected with their corresponding
structural material. There are
indications, however, that the
leaves were large and complexly
divided.</p>
<p>The fructifications were presumably
fern sporangia of normal
but rather massive type.
Of most genera they are not
known, though in a few they
have been found in connection
with recognizable parts of their
tissue. The best known of the
sporangia are large, in comparison
with living sporangia
(actually about 2.5 millimetres
long), oval sacs clustered together
on little pedicels. The
spores within them seem in no
way essentially different from
normal fern spores.</p>
<p>The coexistence of the Botryopteride&aelig;
and Pteridosperms, and the several points
in the structure of the former which seem to lead up
to the characters of the latter group, are significant.
The Botryopteride&aelig;, even were they an entirely isolated
group, would be interesting from the variety of structures
and the variations of the monostele in their
anatomy; and the prominent place they held in the
Pal&aelig;ozoic flora, as the greatest family of ferns of that
period, gives them an important position in fossil botany.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 90.&mdash;Trache&aelig; of Wood of Botryopteridean Fern in
Longitudinal Section, showing the rows of pits on the walls. (Microphoto.)</p>
<p>The other family of importance in Pal&aelig;ozoic times,
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
the <span class="sc">Marattiace&aelig;</span>, has descendants living at the present
day, though the family is now represented by a small
number of species belonging to but five genera which
are confined to the tropics. Perhaps the best known
of these is the giant &ldquo;Elephant Fern&rdquo;, which sends up
from its underground stock huge complex fronds ten or
a dozen feet high. Other species are of the more usual
size and appearance of ferns, while some have sturdy
trunks above-ground supporting a crown of leaves.
The members of this family have a very complex
anatomy, with several series of steles of large size
and irregular shape. Their fructifications are characteristic,
the sporangia being placed in groups of about
five to a dozen, and fused together instead of ripening
as separate sacs as in the other fern families.</p>
<p>Impressions of leaves with this type of sorus (group
of fern sporangia) are found in the Mesozoic rocks,
and these bridge over the interval between the living
members of the family and those which lived in
Pal&aelig;ozoic times.</p>
<p>In the Coal Measure and Permian periods these
plants flourished greatly, and there are remains of very
numerous species from that time. The family was much
more extensive then than it is now, and the individual
members also seem to have reached much greater
dimensions, for many of them had the habit of large
tree ferns with massive trunks. Up till Triassic times
half of the ferns appear to have belonged to this family;
since then, however, they seem to have dwindled
gradually down to the few genera now existing.</p>
<p>On the Continent fossils of this type with well-preserved
structure have long been known to the general
public, as their anatomy gave the stones a very beautiful
appearance when polished, so that they were used for
decorative purposes by lapidaries before their scientific
interest was recognized.</p>
<p>The members of the Pal&aelig;ozoic Marattiace&aelig; which
have structure preserved generally go by the generic
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
name <i>Psaronius</i>, in which there is a great number of
species. They show considerable uniformity in their
essential structure (in which they differ noticeably from
the group of ferns just described), so that but one type
will be considered.</p>
<p>In external appearance they probably resembled the
&ldquo;tree ferns&rdquo; of the present day (though these belong to
an entirely different family), with massive stumps, some
of which reached a height of 60 ft. The large spreading
leaves were arranged in various ways on the stem, some
in a double row along it, as is seen by the impressions
of the leaf scars, and others in complex spirals. On the
leaves were the spore sacs, which were in groups, some
completely fused like those of the modern members of
the family, and others with independent sporangia
massed in well-defined groups. In their microscopic
structure also they appear to have been closely similar
to those of the living Marattiace&aelig;.</p>
<p>The transverse section of a stem shows the most
characteristic and best-known view of the plant. This
is shown in <a href="#fig91">fig. 91</a>, in somewhat diagrammatic form.</p>
<p>The mass of rootlets which entirely permeate and
surround the outer tissues of the stem is a very striking
and characteristic feature of all the species of <i>Psaronius</i>.
Though such a mass of roots is not found in the living
species, yet the microscopic structure of an individual fossil
root is almost identical with that of a living <i>Marattia</i>.</p>
<p>Though these plants were so successful and so important
in Pal&aelig;ozoic times, the group even then seems
to have possessed little variety and little potentiality for
advance in new directions. They stand apart from the
other fossils, and the few forms which now compose the
living Marattiace&aelig; are isolated from the present successful
types of modern ferns. From the <i>Psaronie&aelig;</i> we can
trace no development towards a modern series of plants,
no connection with another important group in the past.
They appear to have culminated in the later Pal&aelig;ozoic
and to have slowly dwindled ever since. It has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
suggested that the male fructifications of the Bennettite&aelig;
and the Pteridosperms show some likeness to the
Marattiace&aelig;, but there does not seem much to support
any view of phylogenetic connection between them.</p>

<p>Before leaving the pal&aelig;ozoic ferns, mention should
be made of the very numerous leaf impressions which
seem to show true fern characters, though they have not
been connected with material showing their internal
structure. Among them it is rare to get impressions
with the <i>sori</i> or sporangia, but such are known and are
in themselves enough to prove the contention that true
ferns existed in the Pal&aelig;ozoic epoch. For it might
be mentioned as a scientific curiosity, that after the
discovery that so many of the leaf impressions which had
always been supposed to be ferns, really belonged to
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
the seed-bearing Pteridosperms, there was a period of
panic among some botanists, who brought forward the
startling idea that there were <i>no</i> ferns at all in the
Pal&aelig;ozoic periods, and that modern ferns were degenerated
seed-bearing plants!</p>
<div class="img" id="fig92">
<img src="images/fig92.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="775" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 92.&mdash;Impression of Pal&aelig;ozoic Fern, showing
<i>sori</i> on the pinnules. (Photo.)</p>
<p>These two big groups from the Pal&aelig;ozoic include
practically all the ferns that then flourished. They have been spoken
of (together with a few other types of which little
is known) as the <i>Primofilices</i>,
a name which emphasizes
their primitive
characters. As can be
seen by the complex organization
of the genera,
however, they themselves
had advanced far beyond
their really primitive ancestors.
There is clear
indication that the Botryopteride&aelig;
were in a
period of change, what
might almost be termed
a condition of flux, and
that from their central
types various families
separated and specialized.
Behind the Botryopteride&aelig;,
however, we have no specimens to show us
the connection between them and the simpler groups
from which they must have sprung. From a detailed
comparative study of plant anatomy we can deduce some
of the essential characters of such ancestral plants, but
here the realm of fossil botany ceases, to give place to
theoretical speculation. As a fact, there is a deep abyss
between the ferns and the other families of the Pteridophytes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
which is not yet bridged firmly enough for any
but specialists, used to the hazardous footing on such
structures, to attempt to cross it. Until the buttresses
and pillars of the bridge are built of the strong stone of
fossil structures we must beware of setting out on what
would prove a perilous journey.</p>
<p>In the Coal Measures and previous periods we see
the ferns already represented by two large families,
differing greatly from each other, and from the main
families of modern ferns which sprung at a later date
from some stock which we have not yet recognized.
But though their past is so obscure, the pal&aelig;ozoic ferns
and their allies throw a brilliant light on the course of
evolution of the higher groups of plants, and the gulf
between ferns and seed-bearing types may be said to
be securely bridged by the Botryopteride&aelig; and the
Pteridosperms.</p>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">VII. The Lycopods</span></h2>
<p>The present-day members of this family are not at
all impressive, and in their lowliness may well be overlooked
by one who is not interested in unpretending
plants. The fresh green mosslike <i>Selaginella</i> grown by
florists as ornamental borders in greenhouses and the
creeping &ldquo;club moss&rdquo; twining among the heather on a
Highland moor are probably the best known of the living
representatives of the Lycopods. In the past the group
held a very different position, and in the distant era of
the Coal Measures it held a dominant one. Many of
the giants of the forest belonged to the family (see <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>),
and the number of species it contained was very
great.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Let us turn at once to this halcyon period of the
group. The history of the times intervening between
it and the present is but the tale of the dying out of the
large species, and the gradual shrinking of the family
and dwarfing of its representative genera.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give the characters of a scientific
family in a few simple words; but perhaps we may
describe the living Lycopods as plants with creeping
stems which divide and subdivide into two with great
regularity, and which bear large numbers of very small
pointed leaves closely arranged round the stem. The
fruiting organs come at the tips of the branches, and
sometimes themselves divide into two, and in these
cone-like axes the spore cases are arranged, a single
one on the upper side of each of the scales (see <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>,
<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>, <span class="small">A</span>). In the Lycopods the spores are all alike, in
the Selaginellas there are larger spores borne in a small
number (four) in some sporangia (see <a href="#fig53">fig. 53</a>, <a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>), and
others in large numbers and of smaller size on the scales
above them. The stems are all very slender, and have
no zones of secondary wood. They generally creep or
climb, and from them are put out long structures something
like roots in appearance, which are specially modified
stem-like organs giving rise to roots.</p>
<p>From the fossils of the Coal Measures <i>Lepidodendron</i>
must be chosen as the example for comparison. The
different species of this genus are very numerous, and
the various fossilized remains of it are among the commonest
and best known of pal&aelig;ontological specimens.
The huge stems are objects of public interest, and have
been preserved in the Victoria Park in Glasgow in their
original position in the rocks, apparently as they grew
with their spreading rootlike organs running horizontally.
A great stump is also preserved in the Manchester
Museum, and is figured in the <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>.
While among the casts and impressions the leaf bases
of the plant are among the best preserved and the most
beautiful (see <a href="#fig93">fig. 93</a>). The cone has already been illustrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
(see <a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a> and <a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), and is one of the best
known of fossil fructifications.</p>

<p>From the abundant, though scattered material, fossil
botanists have reconstructed the plants in all their detail.
The trunks were lofty and of great thickness, bearing
towards the apex a much-branched crown, the branches,
even down to the finest twigs, all dividing into two equal
parts. The leaves, as would be expected from the great
size of the plants, were much bigger than those of the
recent species (<a href="#fig93">fig. 93</a> shows the actual size of the leaf
bases), but they were of the same <i>relatively</i> small size
as compared with the stems, and of the same simple
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
pointed shape. A transverse section across the apex
of a fertile branch shows these closely packed leaves
arranged in series round the axis, those towards the
outside show the central vascular strand which runs
through each.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 94.&mdash;Section across an Axis surrounded by many Leaves, which shows their simple
shape and single central vascular bundle <i>v</i></p>
<p>The markings left on the well-preserved leaf-scars
indicate the main features of the internal anatomy of the
leaves. They had a single central vascular strand (<i>v</i>,
<a href="#fig93">fig. 93</a>), on either side of which ran a strand of soft
tissue <i>p</i> called the parichnos, which is characteristic of
the plants of this group. While another similarly obscure
structure associated with the leaf is the little scale-like
ligule <i>l</i> on its upper surface.</p>
<p>The anatomy of the stems is interesting, for in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
different species different stages of advance are to be
found, from the simple solid protostele with a uniform
mass of wood to hollow ring steles with a pith. An
interesting intermediate stage between these two is found
in <i>Lepidodendron selaginoides</i> (see <a href="#fig95">fig. 95</a>), where the
central cells of the wood are not true water-conducting
cells, but short irregular water-storage tracheides (see
<a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>), which are mixed with parenchyma. All the
genera of these fossils have a single central stele, round
which it is usual to find a zone of secondary wood of
greater or less extent according to the age of the plant.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig95">
<img src="images/fig95.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="431" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 95.&mdash;Transverse Section of <i>Lepidodendron selaginoides</i>, showing the circular mass of

<p class="caption"><i>s</i>, Zone of secondary wood; <i>c</i>, inner cortical tissues; <i>r</i>, intrusive burrowing rootlet;
<i>oc</i>, outer cortical tissues with corky external layers <i>k</i>. (Microphoto.)</p>
<p>Some stems instead of this compact central stele have
a ring of wood with an extensive pith. Such a type is
illustrated in <a href="#fig96">fig. 96</a>, which shows but a part of the circle
of wood, and the zone of the secondary wood outside it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
which greatly exceeds the primary mass in thickness.
This zone of secondary wood became very extensive in
old stems, for, as will be imagined, the primary wood
was not sufficient to supply the large trunks. The
method of its development from a normal cambium
in radiating rows of uniform tracheides is quite similar
to that which is found in the pines to-day. This is the
most important difference between the living and the
fossil stems of the family, for no living plants of the
family have such secondary wood. On the other hand,
the individual elements of this wood are different from
those of the higher families hitherto considered, and
have narrow slit-like pits separated by bands of thickening
on the longitudinal walls. Such tracheides are found
commonly in the Pteridophytes, both living and fossil. Their type is seen in
<a href="#fig96b">fig. 96, <span class="small">B</span></a>, which should be compared
with that in figs. <a href="#fig78a">78, <span class="small">A</span></a>
and <a href="#fig62b">62, <span class="small">B</span></a>

<p>To supply the vascular tissues of the leaf traces,
simple strands come off from the outer part of the primary
wood, where groups of small-celled protoxylem
project (see <i>px</i> in <a href="#fig97">fig. 97</a>). The leaf strands <i>lt</i> move
out through the cortex in considerable numbers to supply
the many leaves, into each of which a single one enters.</p>

<i>Lepidodendron</i> bore several distinct types of cones of
different degrees of complexity. In several of the
genera the cones were simple in organization, directly
comparable with those of the living Lycopods, though
on a much larger scale (see <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>). In some the spores
were uniform, all developing equally in numerous tetrads.
The sporophyll was radially extended, and along it the
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
large sausage-shaped sporangia were attached (see <a href="#fig98">fig. 98</a>).
The tips of the sporophylls overlapped and afforded
protection to the sporangia. The axis of the cone had
a central stele with wood elements like those in the
stem. The appearance of a transverse section of an
actual cone is shown in <a href="#fig99">fig. 99</a>. Here the sporangia
are irregular in shape, owing to their contraction after
ripeness and during fossilization. Other cones had sporangia
similar in size and shape, but which produced spores of two
kinds, large ones resulting from the ripening of only two or
three tetrads in the lower sporangia, and numerous small ones
in the sporangia above.</p>

<p>The similarity between the <i>Lepidodendron</i> and the modern
Lycopod cone has been pointed out already (<a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>), and it
is this which forms the principal guarantee that they
belong to the same family, though the size and wood
development of the pal&aelig;ozoic and the modern plants
differ so greatly.</p>
<p>The large group of the Lepidodendra included
some members whose fructifications had advanced so
far beyond the simple sporangial cones described above
as to approach very closely to seeds in their construction.
This type was described on <a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>, <a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>, in a series of
female fructifications, so that its essential structure need
not be recapitulated.</p>

feature of the plant is that

<p>This type of fructification is the nearest approach to seed and
pollen grains reached by any of the Pteridophytes, and its appearance
at a time when the Lycopods were one of the dominant families
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
is suggestive of the effect that such a position has on
the families occupying it, however lowly they may be.
The simple Pteridophyte Lycopods had not only the
tall trunks and solid woody structure of a modern tree,
but also a semblance of its seeds. Whether this line
of development ever led on to any of the higher families
is still uncertain. The feeling of most specialists is that
it did not; but there are not wanting men who support
the view that the lycopod affinity evolved in time and
entered the ranks of the higher plants, and indeed there
are many points of superficial likeness between the
pal&aelig;ozoic Lycopods and the Conifer&aelig;. Judged from
their internal structure, however, the series through the
ferns and Pteridosperms leads much more convincingly
to the seed plants.</p>
<p>In their roots, or rather in the underground structures
commonly called roots, the Lepidodendrons were
also remarkable. Even more symmetrically than in
their above-ground branching, the base of their trunks
divided; there were four main large divisions, each of
which branched into two and these into two again.
These structures were called <i>Stigmaria</i>, and were common
to all species of <i>Lepidodendron</i> and also the group of
<i>Sigillaria</i> (see <a href="#fig102">fig. 102</a>). On these horizontally running
structures (well shown in the <a href="#front">frontispiece</a>) small appendages
were borne all over their surface in great profusion,
which were, both in their function and microscopic structure,
rootlets. They left circular scars of a characteristic
appearance on the big trunks, of which they were the
only appendages. These scars show clearly on the
fragments along the ledge to the left of the photograph.
The exact morphological nature of the big axes is not
known; their anatomy is not like that of roots, but is
that of a stem, yet they do not bear what practically
every stem, whether underground or not, has developed,
namely leaves, or scales representing reduced leaves.
Their nature has been commented on previously (<a href="#Page_69">p. 69</a>),
and we cannot discuss the point further, but must be
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
content to consider them as a form of root-bearing stem,
practically confined to the Lycopods and principally
developed among the pal&aelig;ozoic fossils of that group.</p>

<p>In microscopic structure the rootlets are extremely
well known, because in their growth they have penetrated
the masses of the tissues of other plants which
were being petrified and have become petrified with
them. The mass of decaying vegetable tissue on which
the living plants of the period flourished were everywhere
pierced by these intrusive rootlets, and they are
found petrified inside otherwise perfect seeds, in the
hearts of woody stems, in leaves and sporangia, and
sometimes even inside each other! <a href="#fig95">Fig. 95</a> shows such
a root <i>r</i> lying in the space left by the decay of the soft
tissue of the inner cortex in an otherwise excellently preserved
<i>Lepidodendron</i> stem (see also <a href="#fig101">fig. 101</a>). In
<a href="#fig101">fig. 101</a> their simple structure is seen. They are often extremely
irregular in shape, owing to the way they seem to have twisted and flattened
themselves in order to fit into the tissues they
were penetrating. No root hairs seem to have been
developed in these rootlets, but otherwise their structure
is that of a typical simple root, and very like the swamp-penetrating
rootlets of the living Isoetes.</p>
<p>The Stigmarian axes and their rootlets are very
commonly found in the &ldquo;underclays&rdquo; and &ldquo;gannister&rdquo;
beds which lie below the coal seams (see <a href="#Page_25">p. 25</a>), and
they may sometimes be seen attached to a bit of the
trunk growing upwards through the layers. They and
the aerial stems of Lepidodendron are perhaps the
commonest and most widely known of fossil plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Before leaving the pal&aelig;ozoic Lycopods another genus
must be mentioned, which is also a widely spread and
important one, though it is less well known than its contemporary.
The genus <i>Sigillaria</i> is best known by its
impressions and casts of stems covered by leaf scars.
The stems were sometimes deeply ribbed, and the leaf
scars were arranged in rows and were more or less hexagonal
in outline, as is seen in <a href="#fig102">fig. 102</a>, which shows a
cast and its reverse of the stem of a typical <i>Sigillaria</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig102">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 102.&mdash;Cast and Reverse of Leaf Scars of <i>Sigillaria</i>. In <span class="small">A</span> the shape of the
leaf bases is clearly shown, the central markings in each being the scar of the vascular
bundle and parichnos</p>
<p>In its primary wood <i>Sigillaria</i> differed from <i>Lepidodendron</i>
in being more remote from the type with a
primary solid stele. Its woody structure was that of a
ring, in some cases irregularly broken up into crescent-shaped
bundles. The secondary wood was quite similar
to that of <i>Lepidodendron</i>.</p>
<p><i>Stigmaria</i> and its rootlets belong equally to the two
plants, and hitherto it has been impossible to tell whether
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
any given specimen of <i>Stigmaria</i> had belonged to a
<i>Lepidodendron</i> or a <i>Sigillaria</i>. Between the two genera
there certainly existed the closest affinity and similarity
in general appearance.</p>
<p>These two genera represent the climax of development
of the Lycopod family. In the Lower Mesozoic
some large forms are still found, but all through the
Mesozoic periods the group dwindled, and in the Tertiary
little is known of it, and it seems to have taken
the retiring position it occupies to-day.</p>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">VIII. The Horsetails</span></h2>
<p>The horsetails of to-day all belong to the one genus,
<i>Equisetum</i>, among the different species of which there
is a remarkably close similarity. Most of the species
love swampy land, and even grow standing up through
water; but some live on the dry clay of ploughed fields.
Wherever they grow they usually congregate in large
numbers, and form little groves together. They are
easily recognized by their delicate stems, branching in
bottle-brush fashion, and the small leaves arranged
round them in whorls, with their narrow teeth joined
to a ring at the base. At the end of some of the
branches come the cones, with compactly arranged and
simple sporophylls all of one kind. In England most
plants of this family are but a few inches or a foot in
height, though one species sometimes reaches 6 ft., while
in South America there are groves of delicate-stemmed
plants 20 ft. high.</p>
<p>The ribbed stems and the whorls of small, finely
toothed leaves are the most important external characteristics
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
of the plants, while in their internal anatomy
the hollow stems have very little wood, which is arranged
in a series of small bundles, each associated with a hollow
canal in the ground tissue.</p>
<p>The family stands apart from all others, and even
between it and the group of Lycopods there seems to
be a big gap across which stretch no bonds of affinity.
Has the group always been in a similar position, and
stood isolated in a backwater of the stream of plant
life?</p>
<div class="img" id="fig103">
<img src="images/fig103.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="408" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 103.&mdash;Impression of Leaf Whorl of <i>Equisetites</i> from the Mesozoic Rocks,
showing the narrow toothed form of the leaves. (Photo.)</p>
<p>In the late Tertiary period they seem to have held much the same position
as they do now, and we learn nothing new of them from rocks of that
age. When, however, we come to the Mesozoic, the members of the family are
of greater size, though they appear (to judge from their
external appearance) to have been practically identical
with those now living in all their arrangements.
In some beds their impressions are very numerous, but
unfortunately most are without any indication of internal
structure. Fossils from the Mesozoic are called <i>Equisetites</i>,
a name which indicates that they come very close
to the living ones in their characters. In the Lower
Mesozoic some of these stems seem to have reached the
great size of a couple of feet in circumference, but to
have no essential difference from the others of the
group.</p>
<p>When, however, we come to the Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks we
find many specimens with their structure preserved, and
we are at once in a very different position as regards
the family.</p>
<p>First in the Permian we meet with the important
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
genus of plant called <i>Calamites</i>, which were very abundant
in the Coal Measures. Many of the Calamites were of
great size, for specimens with large trunks have been
found 30 ft. and more long, which when growing must
certainly have been much taller than that. The number
of individuals must also have been very great, for casts
and impressions of the genus are among the commonest
fossils. They were, in fact, one of the dominant groups
of the period. Like the Lycopods, the Equisetace&aelig;
reached their high-water mark of development in the
Carboniferous period; at that time the plants were most
numerous, and of the largest size and most complicated
structure that they ever attained.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig104">
<img src="images/fig104.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="417" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 104.&mdash;Small Branches attached to stouter Axis of <i>Calamites</i>. Photo of Impression</p>
<p>As will be immediately suspected from analogy with
the Lycopods, they differed from the modern members
of the family in their strongly developed anatomy, and
in the strength and quantity of their secondary wood.
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Yet in their external appearance they probably resembled
the living genus in all essentials, and the groves of the
larger ones of to-day growing in the marshes probably
have the appearance that the pal&aelig;ozoic plants would
have had if looked at through a reversed opera glass.</p>
<p><a href="#fig104">Fig. 104</a> is a photograph of some of the small
branches of a Calamite, in which the ribbed stem can
be seen, and on the
small side twigs the
fine, pointed leaves
lying in whorls.</p>
<p>In most of the
fossil specimens, however,
particularly the
larger ones, the ribs
are not those of the
true surface, but are
those marked on the
<i>internal cast</i> of the
pith.</p>

<p>Among tissue
petrifactions there
are many Calamite
stems of various
stages of growth. In
the very young ones
there are only primary
bundles, and
these little stems are like those of a living Equisetum in
their anatomy, and have a hollow pith and small vascular
bundles with canals associated. The fossil forms, however,
soon began to grow secondary wood, which developed
in regular radial rows from a cambium behind the
primary bundles and joined to a complete ring.</p>
<p>A stem in this stage of development is seen in <a href="#fig105">fig. 105</a>,
where only the wood and internal tissues are preserved.
The very characteristic canals associated with the primary
bundles are clearly shown. The amount of secondary
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
wood steadily increased as the stems grew (there appear to
have been no &ldquo;annual rings&rdquo;) till there was a very large
quantity of secondary tissue of regular
texture, through which ran small medullary
rays, so that the stems became
increasingly like those of the higher
plants as they grew older. It is the
primary structure which is the important
factor in considering their affinity,
and that is essentially the same as in
the other members of the family in
which secondary thickening is not
developed. As we have seen already
in other groups of fossils, secondary
wood appears to develop on similar
lines whenever it is needed in any
group, and therefore has but little value
as an indication of systematic position.
This important fact is one, however, which has only
been realized as a result of the study of fossil plants.</p>

a number of cases (see <a href="#fig107">fig. 107</a>), and was simple, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
a single small strand of vascular tissue lying in the
centre. They had certain large cells, sometimes very
black in the fossils, which may have been filled with
mucilage.</p>

<p>The young roots of these plants have a very characteristic
cortex, which consists of cells loosely built together
in a lacelike fashion, with large air spaces, so
that they are much like water plants in their appearance
(see <a href="#fig108">fig. 108</a>). Indeed, so unlike the old roots and the
stems are they, that for long they were called by another
name and supposed to be submerged stems, but their
connection with <i>Calamites</i> is now quite certain. As their
woody axis develops, the secondary tissue increases and
pushes off the lacelike cortex, and the roots become very
similar in their anatomy to the stems. Both have similar
zones of secondary wood, but the roots do not have those
primary canals which are so characteristic of the stems,
and thereby they can be readily distinguished from them.</p>
<p>The fructifications of the Calamites were not unlike
those of the living types of the family, though in some
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
respects slightly more complex. Round each cone axis
developed rings of sporophylls which alternated with
sterile sheathing bracts. Each sporophyll was shaped
like a small umbrella with four spokes, and stood at
right angles to the axis, bearing a sporangium at each
of the spokes. A diagram of this arrangement is seen in
<a href="#fig109">fig. 109</a>.</p>

the sporophyll to which they are attached.</p>
<p>A few single tetrads of spores are enlarged in <a href="#fig111">fig. 111</a>,
where it will be seen that the large spores are of
a similar size, but that the small ones of the tetrads
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
are very irregular. They are aborting members of the
tetrad, and appear to have been used as food by the
other spores. In each sporangium large numbers of
these tetrads develop and all the ripe spores seem to
have been of one size.</p>
<p>In a species of <i>Calamites</i> (<i>C. casheana</i>), otherwise
very similar to the common one we have been considering,
there is a distinct difference in the sizes of the
spores from different sporangia. The small ones, however,
were only about one-third of the diameter of the
large ones, so that the difference was very much less
marked than it was between the small
and large spores of the Lycopods.</p>
<p>Among the pal&aelig;ozoic members of
the group are other genera closely
allied to, but differing from <i>Calamites</i>
in some particulars. One of these is
<i>Arch&aelig;ocalamites</i>, which has a cone
almost identical with that of the living
Equisetums, as it has no sterile bracts
mingled with the umbrella-like sporophylls.
Other genera are more complex
than those described for <i>Calamites</i>,
and even in the simple coned <i>Arch&aelig;ocalamites</i> itself the
leaves are finely branched and divided instead of being
simple scales.</p>
<p>But no genus is so completely known as is <i>Calamites</i>,
which will itself suffice as an illustration of the pal&aelig;ozoic
Equisetace&aelig;. Though the genus, as was pointed out
above, shows several important characters differing from
those of Equisetum, and parallel to some extent to those
of the pal&aelig;ozoic Lycopods, yet these features are more
of a physiological nature than a systematic one, and they
throw no light on the origin of the family or on its connection
with the other Pteridophytes. It is in the extinct
family dealt with in the next chapter that we find what
some consider as a clue to the solution of these problems.</p>

<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">IX. Sphenophyllales</span></h2>
<p>The group to which <i>Sphenophyllum</i> belongs is of
considerable interest and importance, and is, further, one
of those extinct families whose very existence would
never have been suspected had it not been discovered
by fossil botanists. Not only is the family as a whole
extinct, it also shows features in its anatomy which are
not to be paralleled among living stems. <i>Sphenophyllum</i>
became extinct in the Pal&aelig;ozoic period, but its interest
is very real and living to-day, and in the peculiar features
of its structure we see the first clue that suggests a
common ancestor for the still living groups of Lycopods
and Equisetace&aelig;, which now stand so isolated and far
apart.</p>
<p>Before, however, we can consider the affinities of
the group, we must describe the structure of a typical
plant belonging to it. The genus <i>Sphenophyllum</i> includes
several species (for which there are no common
English names, as they are only known to science) whose
differences are of less importance than their points of
similarity, so that one species only, <i>S. plurifoliatum</i>,
will be described.</p>
<p>We have a general knowledge of the external appearance
of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> from the numerous impressions
of leaves attached to twigs which are found
in the rocks of the Carboniferous period. These impressions
present a good deal of variety, but all have
rather delicate stems with whorls of leaves attached at
regular intervals. The specimens are generally easy to
recognize from the shape of the leaves, which are like
broad wedges attached at the point (see <a href="#fig112">fig. 112</a>). In
some cases the leaves are more finely divided and less
fanlike, and it may even happen that on the same branch
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
some may be wedge-shaped like those in <a href="#fig112">fig. 112</a>, and
others almost hairlike. This naturally suggests comparison
with water plants, which have finely divided
submerged leaves and expanded aerial ones. In the
case of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, however, the divided leaves
sometimes come at the upper ends of the stems, quite
near the cones, and so can hardly have been those of
a submerged part. The very delicate stems and some
points in their internal anatomy suggest that the plant
was a trailing creeper which supported itself on the
stouter stems of other plants.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig112">
<img src="images/fig112.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="345" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 112.&mdash;Impression of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> Leaves
attached to the Stem, showing the wedge-shaped leaflets arranged in whorls</p>
<p>The stems were ribbed, but unlike those of the Calamites
the ribs ran straight down the stem through the
nodes, and did not alternate there, so that the bundles
at the node did not branch and fuse as they did in
<i>Calamites</i>.</p>
<p>The external appearance of the long slender cones
was not unlike that of the Calamite cones, though their
internal details showed important distinctions.</p>
<p>In one noticeable external feature the plants differed
from those of the last two groups considered, and that
was in their <i>size</i>. Pal&aelig;ozoic Lycopods and Equisetace&aelig;
reached the dimensions of great trees, but hitherto no
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
treelike form of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> has been discovered,
and in the structure-petrifactions the largest stems we
know were less than an inch in diameter.</p>
<p>In the internal anatomy of these stems lies one of
the chief interests and peculiarities of the plants. In
the very young stage there was a sharply pointed solid

corners of which was a group of small cells, the protoxylems.
The structure of such a stem is like that of
a root, in which the
primary wood all
grows inwards from
the protoxylems towards
the centre, and
had we had nothing
but these isolated
young stems it would
have been impossible
to recognize their true
nature.</p>

<p>Such very young stems are rare, for the development of secondary
wood began early, and it soon greatly exceeded the
primary wood in amount. <a href="#fig114">Fig. 114</a> shows a photograph
of a stem in which the secondary wood is well developed.
The primary triangle of wood is still to be seen in the
centre, and corresponds to that in <a href="#fig113">fig. 113</a>, while closely
fitting to it are the bays of the first-formed secondary
wood, which makes the wood mass roughly circular.
Outside this the secondary wood forms a regular cylinder
round the axis, which shows no sign of annual rings.
The cells of the wood are large and approximately square
in shape, while at the angles formed at the junction of
every four cells is a group of small, thin-walled parenchyma,
see <a href="#fig115">fig. 115</a>. There are no medullary rays going
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
out radially through the wood, such as are found in all
other zones of secondary wood, and in this arrangement
of soft tissue the plants are unique.</p>

<p>Petrified material of leaves and roots is rare, and both are
chiefly known through the work of the French pal&aelig;obotanist
Renault. The leaves are chiefly
remarkable for the bands of sclerized strengthening
tissue, and generally had the structure of aerial, not
submerged leaves. The roots were simple in structure,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and, as in <i>Calamites</i>, had secondary tissue like that in
the stems.</p>
<p>In the case of the fructifications it is the English
material which has yielded the most illuminating specimens.
The cones were long and slender, externally
covered by the closely packed tips of the scales, which
overlapped deeply. Between the whorls of scales lay
the sporangia, attached to their upper sides by slender
stalks. A diagram will best explain how they were arranged
(see <a href="#fig116">fig. 116</a>). Two sporangia were attached to each bract, but their stalks
were of different lengths, so that one sporangium lay near the axis and one
lay outside it toward the tip of the bract.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 116.&mdash;Diagram of Arrangement of Scales and Sporangia

<p class="caption"><span class="small">A</span>, Axis; <i>br</i>, bract; <span class="small">S</span>, sporangium, with stalk <i>st</i>.</p>
<p>In its anatomy the stalk of the cone has certain features
similar to those in the stem proper, which were among
the first indications that led to the discovery that the cone
belonged to <i>Sphenophyllum</i>. There were numerous spores
in each of the sporangia, which had coats ornamented
with little spines when they were ripe (<a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, if examined
with a magnifying glass, will show this). Hitherto
the only spores known are of uniform size, and there
is no evidence that there was any differentiation into
small (male) and large (female) spores such as were
found in some of the Lepidodendrons. In this respect
<i>Sphenophyllum</i> was less specialized than either <i>Lepidodendron</i>
or <i>Calamites</i>.</p>
<p>In the actual sections of <i>Sphenophyllum</i> cones the
numerous sporangia seem massed together in confusion,
but usually some are cut so as to show the attachment
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of the stalk, as in <a href="#fig117">fig. 117</a>, <i>st</i>. As the stalk was long
and slender, but a short length of it is usually cut through
in any one section, and to realize their mode of attachment
to the axis (as shown in <a href="#fig116">fig. 116</a>) it is necessary to
study a series of sections.</p>

<p class="tb">Of the other plants belonging to the group, <i>Bowmanites
R&ouml;meri</i> is specially interesting. Its sporangia
were borne on stalks similar to those of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>,
but each stalk had two sporangia attached to it. Two
sporangia are also borne on each stalk in <i>S. fertile</i>.
These plants help in elucidating the nature of the stalked
sporangia of <i>Sphenophyllum</i>, for they seem to indicate a
direct comparison between them and the sporophylls of
the Equisetales.</p>
<p class="tb">There is, further, another plant, of which we only
know the cone, of still greater importance. This cone
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
(<i>Cheirostrobus</i>) is, however, so complex that it would
take far too much space to describe it in detail. Even
a diagram of its arrangements is extraordinarily elaborate.
To the specialist the cone is peculiarly fascinating,
for its very complexity gives him great scope
for weaving theories about it; but for our purposes most
of these are too abstruse.</p>

longitudinal to the axis. (Modified from Scott.)</p>
<p>Its most important features are the following. Round
the axis were series of scales, twelve in each whorl, and
each scale was divided into an upper and a lower portion,
each of which again divided into three lobes. The
lower three of each of these scale groups were sterile
and bractlike, comparable, perhaps, with the bracts in
<a href="#fig116">fig. 116</a>; while the upper three divisions were stalks
round each of which were four sporangia. Each sporophyll
segment thus resembled the sporophyll of <i>Calamites</i>,
while the long sausage-shaped sporangia themselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
were more like those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. In
<a href="#fig118">fig. 118</a> is a diagram of a trilobed bract with its three
attached sporophylls. Round the axis were very numerous
whorls of such bracts, and as the cone was large
there were enormous numbers of spore sacs.</p>
<p>A point of interest is the character of the wood of
the main axis, which is similar to that of Lepidodendron
in many respects, being a ring of centripetally
developed wood with twelve projecting external points
of protoxylem.</p>
<p>This cone<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
is the most complex fructification of any
of the known Pteridophytes, whether living or fossil,
which alone ensures it a special importance, though for
our purpose the mixed affinities it shows are of greater
interest.</p>
<p>To mention some of its characters:&mdash;The individual
segments of the sporophylls, each bearing four sporangia,
are comparable with those of <i>Calamites</i>, while the individual
sporangia and the length of the sporophyll stalk
are similar in appearance to those of <i>Lepidodendron</i>. The
wood of the main axis also resembles that of a typical
<i>Lepidodendron</i>. The way the vascular bundles of the
bract pass out from the axis, and the way the stalks
bearing the sporangia are attached to the sterile part
of the bracts, are like the corresponding features in
<i>Sphenophyllum</i>, and still more like <i>Bowmanites</i>.</p>
<p>Many other points of comparison are to be found
in these plants, but without going into further detail
enough has been indicated to support the conclusion
that <i>Cheirostrobus</i> is a very important clue to the
affinities of the Sphenophyllales and early Pteridophytes.
It is indeed considered to have belonged to an ancient
stock of plants, from which the Equisetace&aelig;, and <i>Sphenophylla</i>,
and possibly also the Lycopods all sprang.</p>
<p><i>Sphenophyllum</i>, <i>Bowmanites</i>, and <i>Cheirostrobus</i>, a
series of forms that became extinct in the Pal&aelig;ozoic,
remote in their structure from any living types, whose
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
existence would have been entirely unsuspected but for
the work of fossil botany, are yet the clues which have
led to a partial solution of the mysteries surrounding the
present-day Lycopods and Equisetums, and which help
to bridge the chasm between these remote and degenerate
families.</p>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES</span>
<br /><span class="small">X. The Lower Plants</span></h2>
<p>In the plant world of to-day there are many families
including immense numbers of species whose organization
is simpler than that of the groups hitherto considered.
Taken all together they form, in fact, a very
large proportion of the total number of living species,
though the bulk of them are of small size, and many
are microscopic.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;lower plants&rdquo; include all the mosses, and
the flat green liverworts, the lichens, the toadstools, and
all the innumerable moulds and parasites causing plant
diseases, the green weeds growing in water, and all the
seaweeds, large and small, in the sea, the minute green
cells growing in crevices of the bark of trees, and all
the similar ones living by millions in water. Truly a
host of forms with an endless variety of structures.</p>
<p>Yet when we turn to the fossil representatives of
this formidable multitude, we find but few. Indeed, of
the fossil members of all these groups taken together we
know less that is of importance and real interest than
we do of any single family of those hitherto considered.
The reasons for this dearth of fossils of the lower types are
not quite apparent, but one which may have some bearing
on it is the difficulty of mineralization. It is self-evident
that the more delicate and soft-walled any structure is
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the less chance has it of being preserved without decay
long enough to be fossilized. As will have been understood
from Chapter II, even when the process of fossilization
took place, geologically speaking, rapidly, it can
never have been actually accomplished quickly as compared
with the counter processes of decay. Hence all
the lower plants, with their soft tissue and lack of wood
and strengthening cells, seem on the face of it to stand
but little chance of petrifaction.</p>
<p>There is much in this argument, but it is not a
sufficient explanation of the rarity of lower plant fossils.
All through the preceding chapters mention has been
made of very delicate cells, such as pith, spores, and
even germinating spores (see <a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>, <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>), with their
most delicate outgrowing cells. If then such small and
delicate elements from the higher plants are preserved,
why should not many of the lower plants (some of which
are large and sturdy) be found in the rocks?</p>
<p>As regards the first group, the mosses, it is probable
that they did not exist in the Pal&aelig;ozoic period, whence
our most delicately preserved fossils are derived. There
seems much to support the view that they have evolved
comparatively recently although they are less highly
organized than the ferns. Quite recently experiments
have been made with their near allies the liverworts, and
those which were placed for one year under conditions
similar to those under which plant petrifaction took place,
were found to be perfectly preserved at the end of the
period; though they would naturally decay rapidly under
usual conditions. This shows that Bryophyte cells are
not peculiarly incapable of preservation as fossils, and
adds weight to the negative evidence of the rocks,
strengthening the presumption of their late origin.</p>
<p>That some of the lower plants, among the very
lowest and simplest, can be well preserved is shown in
the case of the fossil fungi which often occur in microscopic
sections of pal&aelig;ozoic leaves, where they infest
the higher plants as similar parasitic species do to-day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>We must now bring forward the more important of
the facts known about the fossils of the various groups
of lower plants.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bryophytes.</span>&mdash;<i>Mosses.</i> Of this family there are no
specimens of any age which are so preserved as to show
their microscopical structure. Of impressions there are
a few from various beds which show, with more or less
uncertainty in most cases, stems and leaves of what
appear to be mosses similar to those now extant, but
they nearly all lack the fructifications which would determine
them with certainty. These impressions go by
the name of <i>Muscites</i>, which is a dignified cloak for
ignorance in most cases. The few which are quite satisfactory
as impressions belong to comparatively recent
rocks.</p>
<p><i>Liverworts</i> are similarly scanty, and there is nothing
among them which could throw any light on the living
forms or their evolution. The more common are of the
same types as the recent ones, and are called <i>Marchantites</i>,
specimens of which have been found in beds
of various ages, chiefly, however, in the more recent
periods of the earth&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that among all the delicate
tissue which is so well preserved in the &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; and
other pal&aelig;ozoic petrifactions, there are no specimens
which give evidence of the existence of mosses at that
time. It is not unlikely that they may have evolved
more recently than the other groups of the &ldquo;lower&rdquo;
plants.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Charace&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Members of this somewhat isolated
family (Stoneworts) are better known, as they frequently
occur as fossil casts. This is probably due to
their character, for even while alive they tend to cover
their delicate stems and leaves, and even fruits, with a
limy incrustation. This assists fossilization to some
degree, and fossil Charas are not uncommon. Usually
they are from the recently deposited rocks, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
earliest true Charas date only to the middle of the
Mesozoic.</p>
<p>An interesting occurrence is the petrifaction of masses
of these plants together, which indicate the existence of
an ancient pool in which they must have grown in abundance
at one time. A case has been described where
masses of <i>Chara</i> are petrified where they seem to have
been growing, and in their accumulations had gradually
filled up the pond till they had accumulated to a height
of 8 feet.</p>
<p>The plants, however, have little importance from our
present point of view.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Fungi.</span>&mdash;Of the higher fungi, namely, &ldquo;toadstools&rdquo;,
we have no true fossils. Some indications of them have been
found in amber, but such specimens are so unsatisfactory that they
can hardly afford much interest.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig119">

</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 119.&mdash;The Hyph&aelig; of Fungi Parasitic on a Woody Tree</p>
<p class="caption"><i>c</i>, Cells of host; <i>h</i>, hyph&aelig; of fungus, with dividing cell walls.</p>
<p>The lower fungi, however, and in particular the microscopic and
parasitic forms, occur very frequently, and are found in the Coal
Measure fossils. Penetrating the tissues of the higher plants, their
hosts, the parasitic cells are often excellently preserved, and we may
see their delicate hyph&aelig; wandering from cell to cell as in <a href="#fig119">fig. 119</a>,
while sometimes there are attached swollen cells which seem to be
sporangia. From the Pal&aelig;ozoic we
get leaves with nests of spores of the fungus which had
attacked and spotted them as so many do to leaves to-day
(see <a href="#fig120">fig. 120</a>). What is specially noticeable about
these plants is their similarity to the living forms infesting
the higher plants of the present day. Already in
the Pal&aelig;ozoic the sharp distinction existed between the
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
highly organized independent higher plants and their
simple parasites. The higher plants have changed profoundly
since that time, stimulated by ever-changing
surroundings, but the parasites living within them are
now much as they were then, just sufficiently highly
organized to rob and reproduce.</p>
<p>A form of fungus inhabitant which seems to be
useful to the higher plant appears also to have existed
in Pal&aelig;ozoic times, viz. <i>Mycorhiza</i>. In the roots of
many living trees, particularly such as the Beech and
its allies, the cells of the outer layers are penetrated by
many fungal forms which live in association with the
tree and do it some service at the same time as gaining something
for themselves. This curious, and as yet incompletely
understood physiological relation between the higher
plants and the fungi, existed so far back as the Pal&aelig;ozoic
period, from which roots have been described whose
cells were packed with minute organisms apparently
identical with <i>Mycorhiza</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig120">
<img src="images/fig120.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="161" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 120.&mdash;Fossil Leaf <i>l</i> with Nests of Infesting Fungal
Spores <i>f</i> on its lower side</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Alg&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Green Alg&aelig;</i> (pond weeds). Many impressions
have been described as alg&aelig; from time to time, numbers
of which have since been shown to be a variety of other
things, sometimes not plants at all. Other impressions
may really be those of alg&aelig;, but hitherto they have added
practically nothing to our knowledge of the group.</p>
<p>Several genera of alg&aelig; coat themselves with calcareous
matter while they are alive, much in the same
way as do the Charas, and of these, as is natural, there
are quite a number of fossil remains from Tertiary and
Mesozoic rocks. This is still more the case in the group
of the <i>Red Alg&aelig;</i> (seaweeds), of which the calcareous-coated
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
genera, such as <i>Corallina</i> and others, have many
fossil representatives. These plants appear so like corals
in many cases that they were long held to be of animal
nature. The genus <i>Lithothamnion</i> now grows attached
to rocks, and is thickly encrusted with calcareous matter.
A good many species of this genus have been described
among fossils, particularly from the Tertiary and Cretaceous
rocks. As the plant grew in association with
animal corals, it is not always very easy to separate it
from them.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Brown Alg&aelig;</span> (seaweeds) have often been described
as fossils. This is very natural, as so many fossils have
been found in marine deposits, and when among them
there is anything showing a dark, wavy impression, it
is usually described as a seaweed. And possibly it may
be one, but such an impression does not lead to much
advance in knowledge. From the early Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks
of both Europe and America a large fossil plant is known
from the partially petrified structure of its stem. There
seem to be several species, or at least different varieties
of this, known under the generic name <i>Nematophycus</i>.
Specimens of this genus are found to have several anatomical
characters common to the big living seaweeds
of the <i>Laminaria</i> type, and it is very possible that the
fossils represent an early member of that group. In
none of these petrified specimens, however, is there any
indication of the microscopic structure of reproductive
organs, so that the exact nature of the fossils is not
determinable. It is probable that though perhaps allied
to the Laminarias they belong to an entirely extinct
group.</p>
<p>An interesting and even amusing chapter might be
written on all the fossils which look like alg&aelig; and even
have been described as such. The minute river systems
that form in the moist mud of a foreshore, if preserved
in the rocks (as they often are, with the ripples and raindrops
of the past), look extraordinarily like seaweeds&mdash;as
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
do also countless impressions and trails of animals. In
this portion of the study of fossils it is better to have a
healthy scepticism than an illuminating imagination.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Diatoms</span>, with their hard siliceous shells, are naturally
well preserved as fossils (see <a href="#fig121">fig. 121</a>), for even if the
protoplasm decays the mineral coats remain practically
unchanged.</p>
<p>Diatoms to-day exist in great numbers, both in the
cold water of the polar regions and in the heat of hot
springs. Often, in the latter, one can see them actually
being turned into fossils. In the Yellowstone Park they
are accumulating in vast numbers over large areas, and in
some places have collected to a thickness of 6 feet. At the
bottoms of freshwater lakes they may form an almost pure mud
of fine texture, while on the floor
of deep oceans there is an ooze of diatoms which have
been separated from the calcareous shells by their
greater powers of resistance to solution by salt water.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig121">
<img src="images/fig121.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="153" />
</div>
<p class="caption">Fig. 121.&mdash;Diatom showing the Double Siliceous Coat</p>
<p>There are enormous numbers of species now living,
and of fossils from the Tertiary and Upper Mesozoic
rocks; but, strangely enough, though so numerous and
so widely distributed, both now and in these past periods,
they have not been found in the earlier rocks.</p>
<p>In one way the diatoms differ from ordinary fossils.
In the latter the soft tissues of the plant have been replaced
by stone, while in the former the living cell was
enclosed in a siliceous case which does not decompose,
thus resembling more the fossils of animal shells.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bacteria</span> are so very minute that it is impossible to
recognize them in ordinary cases. In the matrix of the
best-preserved fossils are always minute crystals and
granules that may simulate bacterial shapes perfectly.
<i>Bacillus</i> and <i>Micrococcus</i> of various species have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
described by French writers, but they do not carry
conviction.</p>
<p>As was stated at the beginning of the chapter, from
all the fossils of all the lower-plant families we cannot
learn much of prime importance for the present purpose.
Yet, as the history of plants would be incomplete without
mention of the little that is known, the foregoing pages
have been added.</p>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">FOSSIL PLANTS AS RECORDS OF ANCIENT COUNTRIES</span></h2>
<p>The land which to-day appears so firm and unchanging
has been under the sea many times, and in
many different ways has been united to other land masses
to form continents. At each period, doubtless, the solid
earth appeared as stable as it is now, while the country
was as well characterized, and had its typical scenery,
plants, and animals. We know what an important
feature of the character of any present country is its
flora; and we have no reason to suspect that it was ever
less so than it is to-day. Indeed, in the ages before
men interfered with forest growth, and built their cities,
with their destructive influences, the plants were relatively
more important in the world landscape than they
are to-day.</p>
<p>As we go back in the periods of geological history
we find the plants had an ever-increasing area of distribution.
To-day most individual species and many
genera are limited to islands or parts of continents, but
before the Glacial epoch many were distributed over both
America and Europe. In the Mesozoic <i>Ginkgo</i> was
spread all over the world, and in the present epoch it
was confined to China and Japan till it was distributed
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
again by cultivation; while in the Pal&aelig;ozoic period
<i>Lepidodendron</i> seemed to stretch wellnigh from pole to
pole.</p>
<p>The importance of the relation of plant structure to
the climate and local physical conditions under which it
was growing cannot be too much insisted upon. Modern
biology and ecology are continually enlarging and rendering
more precise our views of this interrelation, so that
we can safely search the details of anatomical structure
of the fossil plants for sidelights on the character of the
countries they inhabited and their climates.</p>
<p>It has been remarked already that most of the fossils
which we have well preserved, whether of plants or
animals, were fossilized in rocks which collected under
sea water; yet it was also noted that of marine plants
we have almost no reliable fossils at all. How comes
this seeming contradiction?</p>
<p>The lack of marine plant fossils probably depends on
their easily decomposable nature, while the presence of
the numerous land plants resulted from their drifting out
to sea in streams and rivers, or dropping into the still
salt marshes where they grew. Hence, in the rocks
deposited in a sea, we have the plants preserved which
grew on adjacent lands. In fresh water, also, the plants
of the neighbourhood were often fossilized; but actually
on the land itself but little was preserved. The winds
and rains and decay that are always at work on a land
area tend to break down and wash away its surface, not
to build it up.</p>
<p>There are many different details which are used in
determining the evidence of a fossil plant. Where leaf
impressions are preserved which exhibit a close similarity
to living species (as often happens in the Tertiary period),
it is directly assumed that they lived under conditions
like those under which the present plants of that kind
are living; while, if the anatomy is well preserved (as
in the Pal&aelig;ozoic and several Mesozoic types), we can
compare its details with that of similar plants growing
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
under known conditions, and judge of the climate that
had nurtured the fossil plant while it grew.</p>
<p>Previous to the present period there was what is so
well known as the Glacial epoch. In the earthy deposits
of this age in which fossils are found plants are not uncommon.
They are of the same kind as those now
growing in the cold regions of the Arctic circle, and on
the heights of hills whose temperature is much lower
than that of the surrounding lowlands. Glacial epochs
occurred in other parts of the world at different times;
for example, in South Africa, in the Permo-Carboniferous
period, during which time the fossils indicate that the
warmth-loving plants were driven much farther north
than is now the case.</p>
<p>It is largely from the nature of the plant fossils that
we know the climate of England at the time preceding
the Glacial epoch. Impressions of leaves and stems,
and even of fruits, are abundant from the various periods
of the Tertiary. Many of them were Angiosperms (see
<a href="#c8">Chap. VIII</a>), and were of the families and even genera
which are now living, of which not a few belong to the
warm regions of the earth, and are subtropical. It is
generally assumed that the fossils related to, or identical
with, these plants must therefore have found in Tertiary
Northern Europe a much warmer climate than now
exists. Not only in Northern Europe, but right up
into the Arctic circle, such plants occur in Tertiary
rocks, and even if we had not their living representatives
with which to compare them, the large size and
thin texture of their leaves, their smoothness, and a
number of other characteristics would make it certain
that the climate was very much milder than it is at
present, though the value of some of the evidence has
been overestimated.</p>
<p>From the Tertiary we are dependent chiefly on impressions
of fossils; anatomical structure would doubtless
yield more details, but even as it is we have quite
enough evidence to throw much light on the physiography
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of the Tertiary period. The causes for such
marked changes of climate must be left for the consideration
of geologists and astronomers. Plants are
passive, driven before great climatic changes, though
they have a considerable influence on rainfall, as has
been proved repeatedly in India in recent times.</p>
<p>From the more distant periods it is the plants of the
Carboniferous, whose structure we know so well, that
teach us most. Although there is still very much to
be done before knowledge is as complete as we should
wish, there are sufficient facts now discovered to correct
several popular illusions concerning the Pal&aelig;ozoic period.
The &ldquo;deep, all-enveloping mists, through which the sun&rsquo;s
rays could scarcely penetrate&rdquo;, which have taken the
popular imagination, appear to have no foundation in
fact. There is nothing in the actual structure of the
plants to indicate that the light intensity of the climate
in which they grew was any less than it is in a smoke-free
atmosphere to-day.</p>
<p>Look at the &ldquo;shade leaves&rdquo; of any ordinary tree,
such as a Lime or Maple, and compare them with those
growing in the sunlight, even on the same tree. They
are larger and softer and thinner. To absorb the same
amount of energy as the more brilliantly lighted leaves,
they must expose a larger surface to the light. Hence
if the Coal Measure plants grew in very great shade,
to supply their large growth with the necessary sun
energy we should expect to find enormous spreading
leaves. But what is the fact? No such large leaves are
known. <i>Calamites</i> and <i>Lepidodendron</i>, the commonest
and most successful plants of the period, had narrow
simple leaves with but a small area of surface. They
were, in fact, leaves of the type we now find growing in
exposed places. The ferns had large divided leaves,
but they were finely lobed and did not expose a large
continuous area as a true &ldquo;shade leaf&rdquo; does; while
the height of their stems indicates that they were growing
in partial shade&mdash;at least, the shade cast by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
small-leaved Calamites and Lepidodendrons which overtopped
them.</p>
<p>Indeed there is no indication from geological evidence
that so late as Pal&aelig;ozoic times there was any
great abnormality of atmosphere, and from the internal
evidence of the plants then growing there is everything
to indicate a dry or physiologically dry<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
sunny condition.</p>
<p>Of the plant fossils from the Coal Measures we have
at least two types. One, those commonly found in
nodules <i>in</i> the coal itself; and the other, nodules in the
rocks above the coal which had drifted from high lands
into the sea.</p>
<p>The former are the plants which actually formed the
coal itself, and from their internal organization we see
that these plants were growing with partly submerged
roots in brackish swamps. Their roots are those of
water plants (see <a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>, young root of Calamite), but
their leaves are those of the &ldquo;protected&rdquo; type with
narrow surface and various devices for preventing a loss
of water by rapid transpiration. If the water they grew
in had been fresh they would not have had such leaves,
for there would have been no need for them to economize
their water, but, as we see in bogs and brackish or salt
water to-day (which is physiologically usable in only
small quantities by the plant), plants even partly submerged
protect their exposed leaves from transpiring
largely.</p>
<p>There are details too numerous to mention in connection
with these coal-forming plants which go to prove
that there were large regions of swampy ground near
the sea where they were growing in a bright atmosphere
and uniform climate. Extensive areas of coal, and geological
evidence of still more extensive deposits, show
that in Europe in the Coal Measure period there were
vast flats, so near the sea level that they were constantly
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
being submerged and appearing again as d&eacute;bris drifted
and collected over them. Such a land area must have
differed greatly from the Europe now existing, in all its
features. But the whole continent did not consist of
these flats; there were hills and higher ground, largely
to the north-east, on which a dry land flora grew, a
flora where several of the Pteridosperms and <i>Cordaites</i>
with its allies were the principal plants. These plants
have leaves so organized as to suggest that they grew
in a region where the climate was bright and dry.</p>
<p>A fossil flora which has aroused much interest,
particularly among geologists, is that known as the
Glossopteris flora. This Pal&aelig;ozoic flora has in general
characters similar to those of the European Permo-Carboniferous,
but it has special features of its own, in
particular the genus <i>Glossopteris</i> and also the genera
<i>Phyllotheca</i> and <i>Schizoneura</i>.</p>
<p>These genera, with a few others, are characteristic
of the Permo-Carboniferous period in the regions in the
Southern Hemisphere now known by the names of Australasia,
South Africa, and South America, and in India.
These regions, at that date, formed what is called
by geologists &ldquo;Gondwanaland&rdquo;. In the rocks below
those containing the plants there is evidence of glacial
conditions, and it is not impossible that this great
difference in climate accounts for the differences which
exist between the flora of the Gondwanaland region and
the Northern Hemisphere. Unfortunately we have not
microscopically preserved specimens of the Glossopteris
flora, which could be compared with those of our own
Pal&aelig;ozoic.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>To describe in detail the series of changes through
which the seas and continents have passed belongs to
the realm of pure geology. Here it is only necessary to
point out how the evidence from the fossil plants may
afford much information concerning these continents,
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and as our knowledge of fossil anatomy and of recent
ecology increases, their evidence will become still more
weighty. Even now, had we no other sources of information,
we could tell from the plants alone where in
the past continents were snow and ice, heat and drought,
swamps and hilly land. However different in their
systematic position or scale of evolutional development,
plants have always had similar minute structure and
similar physiological response to the conditions of climate
and land surface, so that in their petrified cells are preserved
the histories of countries and conditions long
past.</p>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>In the stupendous pageant of living things which
moves through creation, the plants have a place unique
and vitally important. Yet so quietly and so slowly
do they live and move that we in our hasty motion often
forget that they, equally with ourselves, belong to the
living and evolving organisms. When we look at the
relative structures of plants divided by long intervals
of time we can recognize the progress they make; and
this is what we do in the study of fossil botany. We
can place the salient features of the flora of Pal&aelig;ozoic
and Mesozoic eras in a few pages of print, and the contrast
becomes surprising. But the actual distance in
time between these two types of plants is immense, and
must have extended over several million years; indeed
to speak of years becomes meaningless, for the duration
of the periods must have been so vast that they pass
beyond our mental grasp. In these periods we find a
contrast in the characters of the plants as striking as that
in the characters of the animals. Whole families died
out, and new ones arose of more complex and advanced
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
organization. But in height and girth there is little
difference between the earliest and the latest trees; there
seems a limit to the possible size of plants on this planet,
as there is to that of animals, the height of mountains,
or the depth of the sea. The &ldquo;higher plants&rdquo; are often
less massive and less in height than the lower&mdash;Man is
less in stature than was the Dinosaur&mdash;and though by
no legitimate stretch of the imagination can we speak
of brain in plants, there is an unconscious superiority of
adaptation by which the more highly organized plants
capture the soil they dominate.</p>
<p>It has been noted in the previous chapters that so
far back as the Coal Measure period the vegetative parts
of plants were in many respects similar to those of the
present, it was in the reproductive organs that the
essential differences lay. Naturally, when a race (as
all races do) depends for its very existence on the chain
of individuals leading from generation to generation, the
most important items in the plant structures must be
those mechanisms concerned with reproduction. It is
here that we see the most fundamental differences between
living and fossil plants, between the higher and
the lower of those now living, between the forest trees
of the present and the forest trees of the past. The
wood of the pal&aelig;ozoic Lycopods was in the quality and
extent and origin of its secondary growth comparable
with that of higher plants still living to-day&mdash;yet in the
fruiting organs how vast is the contrast! The Lycopods,
with simple cones composed of scales in whose huge
sporangia were simple single-celled spores; the flowering
plants, with male and female sharply contrasted yet growing
in the same cone (one can legitimately compare a
flower with a cone), surrounded by specially coloured
and protective scales, and with the &ldquo;spore&rdquo; in the tissue
of the young seed so modified and changed that it is
only in a technical sense that comparison with the Lycopod
spore is possible.</p>
<p>To study the minute details of fossil plants it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
necessary to have an elaborate training in the structure
of living ones. In the preceding chapters only the salient
features have been considered, so that from them we can
only glean a knowledge similar to the picture of a house
by a Japanese artist&mdash;a thing of few lines.</p>
<p>Even from the facts brought together in these short
chapters, however, it cannot fail to be evident how large
a field fossil botany covers, and with how many subjects
it comes in touch. From the minute details of plant
anatomy and evolution pure and simple to the climate
of departed continents, and from the determination of
the geological age of a piece of rock by means of a
blackened fern impression on it to the chemical questions
of the preservative properties of sea water, all is
a part of the study of &ldquo;fossil botany&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To bring together the main results of the study in
a graphic form is not an easy task, but it is possible to
construct a rough diagram giving some indication of the
distribution of the chief groups of plants in the main
periods of time (see <a href="#fig122">fig. 122</a>).</p>
<p>Such a diagram can only represent the present state
of our imperfect knowledge; any day discoveries may
extend the line of any group up or down in the series,
or may connect the groups together.</p>
<p>It becomes evident that so early as the Pal&aelig;ozoic
there are nearly as many types represented as in the
present day, and that in fact everything, up to the
higher Gymnosperms, was well developed (for it is hard
indeed to prove that <i>Cordaites</i> is less highly organized
than some of the present Gymnosperm types), but
flowering plants and also the true cycads are wanting,
as well as the intermediate Mesozoic Bennettitales.
The peculiar groups of the period were the Pteridosperm
series, connecting links between fern and cycad,
and the Sphenophyllums, connecting in some measure
the Lycopods and Calamites. With them some of the
still living groups of ferns, Lycopods, and Equisetace&aelig;
were flourishing, though all the species differed from
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
those now extant. This shows us how very far from
the beginning our earliest information is, for already in
the Pal&aelig;ozoic we have a flora as diversified as that
now living, though with more primitive characters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>

<p class="caption">Fig. 122.&mdash;Diagram showing the relative distribution of the main groups of plants
through the geological eras. The dotted lines connecting the groups and those in the
pre-Carboniferous are entirely theoretical, and merely indicate the conclusions reached at
present. The size of the surface of each group roughly indicates the part it played in the
flora of each period. Those with dotted surface bore seeds, the others spores.</p>
<p>In Mesozoic times the most striking group is that of
the Cycads and Bennettitales, the latter branch suggesting
a direct connection between the fern-cycad series
and the flowering plants. This view, so recently published
and upheld by various eminent botanists, is fast
gaining ground. Indeed, so popular has it become
among the specialists that there is a danger of overlooking
the real difficulties of the case. The morphological
leap from the leaves and stems of cycads to those
of the flowering plants seems a much more serious
matter to presuppose than is at present recognized.</p>
<p>As is indicated in the diagram, the groups do not
appear isolated by great unbridged gaps, as they did
even twenty years ago. By means of the fossils either
direct connections or probable lines of connection are
discovered which link up the series of families. At
present the greatest gap now lies hedging in the Moss
family, and, as was mentioned (<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>), fossil botany
cannot as yet throw much light on that problem owing
to the lack of fossil mosses.</p>
<p class="tb">This glimpse into the past suggests a prophecy for
the future. Evolution having proceeded steadily for
such vast periods is not likely to stop at the stage
reached by the plants of to-day. What will be the
main line of advance of the plants of the future, and
how will they differ from those of the present?</p>
<p>We have seen in the past how the differentiation of
size in the spores resulted in sex, and in the higher
plants in the modifications along widely different lines
of the male and female; how the large spore (female)
became enclosed in protecting tissues, which finally
led up to true seeds (see <a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a>), while the male being
so temporary had no such elaboration. As the seed
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
advances it becomes more and more complex, and when
we reach still higher plants further surrounding tissues
are pressed into its service and it becomes enclosed in
the carpel of the highest flowering plants. After that the
seed itself has fewer general duties, and instead of those
of the Gymnosperms with large endosperms collecting
food before the embryo appears, small ovules suffice,
which only develop after fertilization is assured. The
various families of flowering plants have gone further, and
the whole complex series of bracts and fertile parts which
make up a flower is adapted to ensure the crossing of
male and female of different individuals. The complex
mechanisms which seem adapted for &ldquo;cross fertilization&rdquo;
are innumerable, and are found in the highest groups of
the flowering plants. But some have gone beyond the
stage when the individual flowers had each its device,
and accomplished its seed-bearing independently of the
other flowers on the same branch. These have a combination
of many flowers crowded together into one
community, in which there is specialization of different
flowers for different duties. In such a composite flower,
the Daisy for example, some are large petalled and
brightly coloured to attract the pollen-carrying insects,
some bear the male organs only, and others the female
or seed-producing. Here, then, in the most advanced
type of flowering plant we get back again to the separation
of the sexes in separate flowers; but these flowers
are combined in an organized community much more
complex than the cones of the Gymnosperms, for example,
where the sexes are separate on a lower plane of
development.</p>
<p>It seems possible that an important group, if not the
dominant group, of flowering plants in the future will be
so organized that the individual flowers are very simple,
with fewer parts than those of to-day, but that they will
be combined in communities of highly specialized individuals
in each flower head or cluster.</p>
<p>As well as this, in other species the minute structure
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of the vital organs may show a development in a direction
contrary to what has hitherto seemed advance.
Until recently flowers and their organs have appeared
to us to be specialized in the more advanced groups on
such lines as encourage &ldquo;cross fertilization&rdquo;. In &ldquo;cross
fertilization&rdquo;, in fact, has appeared to lie the secret of the
strength and advance of the races of plants. But modern
cytologists have found that many of the plants long
believed to depend on cross fertilization are either self-fertilized
or not fertilized at all! They have passed
through the period when their complex structures for
ensuring cross fertilization were used, and though they
retain these external structures they have taken to a
simpler method of seed production, and in some cases
have even dispensed with fertilization of the egg cell
altogether. The female vitality increased, the male becomes
superfluous. It is simpler and more direct to
breed with only one sex, or to use the pollen of the same
individual. Many flowers are doing this which until
recently had not been suspected of it. We cannot yet
tell whether it will work successfully for centuries to
come or is an indication of &ldquo;race senility&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Whether in the epochs to come flowering plants will
continue to hold the dominant position which they now
do is an interesting theoretical problem. Flowers were
evolved in correlation with insect pollination. One can
conceive of a future, when all the earth is under
dominion of man, in which fruits will be sterilized for
man&rsquo;s use, as the banana is now, and seed formation
largely replaced by gardeners&rsquo; &ldquo;cuttings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In those plants which are now living where the complex
mechanisms for cross-fertilization have been superseded
by simple self-fertilization, the external parts of the
more elaborate method are still produced, though they are
apparently futile. In the future these vestigial organs
will be discarded, or developed in a more rudimentary
form (for it is remarkable how organs that were once
used by the race reappear in members of it that have
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
long outgrown their use), and the morphology of the
flower will be greatly simplified.</p>
<p>Thus we can foresee on both sides much simplified
individual flowers&mdash;in the one group the reduced individuals
associating together in communities the members
of which are highly specialized, and in the other the
solitary flowers becoming less elaborate and conspicuous,
as they no longer need the assistance of insects (the
cleistogamic flowers of the Violet, for example, even in
the present day bend toward the earth, and lack all
the bright attractiveness of ordinary flowers), and perhaps
finally developing underground, where the seeds
could directly germinate.</p>
<p>In the vegetative organs less change is to be expected,
the examples from the past lead us to foresee
no great difference in size or general organization of
the essential parts, though the internal anatomy has
varied, and probably will vary, greatly with the whole
evolution of the plant.</p>
<p>But one more point and we must have done. Why
do plants evolve at all? Why did they do so through
the geological ages of the past, and why should we
expect them to do so in the future? The answer to
this question must be less assured than it might have
been even twenty years ago, when the magnetism of
Darwin&rsquo;s discoveries and elucidations seemed to obsess
his disciples. &ldquo;Response to environment&rdquo; is undoubtedly
a potent factor in the course of evolution,
but it is not the cause of it. There seems to be something
inherent in life, something apparently (though
that may be due to our incomplete powers of observation)
apart from observable factors of environment
which causes slight spontaneous changes, <i>mutations</i>, and
some individuals of a species will suddenly develop in
a new direction in one or other of their parts. If, then,
this places them in a superior position as regards their
environment or neighbours, it persists, but if not, those
individuals die out. The work of a special branch of
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
modern botany seems clearly to indicate the great importance
of this seemingly inexplicable spontaneity of
life. In environment alone the thoughtful student of
the present cannot find incentive enough for the great
changes and advances made by organisms in the course
of the world&rsquo;s history. The climate and purely physical
conditions of the Coal Measure period were probably
but little different from those in some parts of
the world to-day, but the plants themselves have fundamentally
changed. True, their effect upon each other
must be taken into account, but this is a less active
factor with plants than with men, for we can imagine
nothing equivalent to citizenship, society, and education
in the plant communities, which are so vital in human
development.</p>
<p>It seems to have been proved that plants and animals
may, at certain unknown intervals, &ldquo;mutate&rdquo;; and mutation
is a fine word to express our recent view of one
of the essential factors in evolution. But it is a cloak
for an ignorance avowedly less mitigated than when we
thought to have found a complete explanation of the
causes of evolution in &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="tb">In a sketch such as the present, outlines alone are
possible, detail cannot be elaborated. If it has suggested
enough of atmosphere to show the vastness of the landscape
spreading out before our eyes back into the past
and on into the future, the task has been accomplished.
There are many detailed volumes which follow out one or
other special line of enquiry along the highroads and by-ways
of this long traverse in creation. If the bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the country given in this book entices some to
foot it yard by yard under the guidance of specialists
for each district, it will have done its part. While to
those who will make no intimate acquaintance with so
far off a land it presents a short account by a traveller,
so that they may know something of the main features
and a little of the romance of the fossil world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c20">APPENDIX I
<br /><span class="small">LIST OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A COLLECTING EXPEDITION</span></h2>
<p>In order to obtain the best possible results from an expedition,
it is well to go fossil hunting in a party of two, four,
or six persons. Large parties tend to split up into detachments,
or to waste time in trying to keep together.</p>
<p>Each individual should have strong suitable clothes, with as
many pockets arranged in them as possible. The weight of the
stones can thus be distributed over the body, and is not felt so
much as if they were all carried in a knapsack. Each collector
should also provide himself with&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A satchel or knapsack, preferably of leather or strong
canvas, but not of large size, for when the space is
limited selection of the specimens is likely to be made
carefully.</p>
<p>One or two hammers. If only one is carried, it should be
of a fair size with a square head and strong straight
edge.</p>
<p>One chisel, entirely of metal, and with a strong straight
cutting edge.</p>
<p>Soft paper to wrap up the more delicate fossils, in order to
prevent them from scraping each other&rsquo;s surfaces; and
one or two small cardboard boxes for very fragile
specimens.</p>
<p>A map of the district (preferably geologically coloured).
Localities should be noted in pencil on this, indicating
the exact spot of finds. For general work the one-inch
survey map suffices, but for detailed work it is
necessary to have the six-inch maps of important
districts.</p>
<p>A small notebook. Few notes are needed, but those few
<i>must</i> be taken on the spot to be reliable.</p>
<p>A pencil or fountain pen, preferably both.</p>
<p>A penknife, which, among other things, will be found useful
for working out very delicate fossils.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c21">APPENDIX II
<br /><span class="small">TREATMENT OF SPECIMENS</span></h2>
<p>1. The commonest form in which fossils are collected is that
which has been described as <i>impression material</i> (see <a href="#Page_12">p. 12</a>). In
many cases these will need no further attention after the block
of stone on which they lie has been chipped into shape.</p>
<p>In chipping a block down to the size required it is best to
hold it freely in the left hand, protecting the actual specimen
with the palm where possible, and taking the surplus edges
away by means of short sharp blows from the hammer, striking
so that only small pieces come away with each blow. For
delicate specimens it is wise to leave a good margin of the
matrix round the specimen, and to do the final clearing with a
thin-bladed penknife, taking away small flakes of the stone with
delicate taps on the handle of the knife.</p>
<p>Specimens from fine sandstones, shales, and limestones are
usually thoroughly hard and resistant, and are then much better
if left without treatment; by varnishing and polishing them
many amateur collectors spoil their specimens, for a coat of
shiny varnish often conceals the details of the fossil itself.
Impressions of plants on friable shales, on the other hand, or
those which have a tendency to peel off as they dry, will require
some treatment. In such cases the best substance to use is a
dilute solution of size, in which the specimen should soak for a
short period while the liquid is warm (not hot), after which it
should be slightly drained and the size allowed to dry in. The
congealed substance then holds the plant film on to the rock
surface and prevents the rock from crumbling away, while it is
almost invisible and does not spoil the plant with any excessive
glaze.</p>
<p>2. For specimens of <i>casts</i> the same treatment generally applies,
though they are more apt to separate completely from the
matrix after one or two sharp blows, and thus save one the work
of picking out the details of their structure.</p>
<p>3. Those blocks which contain <i>petrifactions</i>, and can therefore
be made to show microscopic details, will require much
more treatment. In some cases mere polishing reveals much of
the structure&mdash;such, for instance, were the &ldquo;Staarsteine&rdquo; of the
German lapidaries, where the axis and rootlets of a fossil like a
treefern show their very characteristic pattern distinctly.</p>
<p>As a rule, however, it is better, and for any detailed work it
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
is essential, to cut thin sections transversely across and longitudinally
through the axis of the specimen and to grind them
down till they are so transparent that they can be studied
through the microscope. The cutting can be done on a lapidary&rsquo;s
wheel, where a revolving metal disc set with diamond
powder acts as a knife. The comparatively thin slice thus
obtained is fastened on to glass by means of hard Canada
balsam, and rubbed down with carborundum powder till it is
thin enough.</p>
<p>The process, however, is very slow, and an amateur cannot
get good results without spending a large amount of time and
patience over the work which would be better spent over the
study of the plant structures themselves. Therefore it is usually
more economical to send specimens to be cut by a professional,
if they are good enough to be worth cutting at all, though it
is often advisable to cut through an unpromising block to see
whether its preservation is such as would justify the expense.</p>
<p>In the case of true &ldquo;coal balls&rdquo; much can be seen on the cut
surface of a block, particularly if it be washed for a minute in
dilute hydrochloric acid and then in water, and then dried
thoroughly. The acid acts on the carbonates of which the
stone is largely composed, and the treatment accentuates the
black-and-white contrast in the petrified tissues (see <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>).
After lying about for a few months the sharpness of the surface
gets rubbed off, as the acid eats it into very delicate irregularities
which break and form a smearing powder; but in such a case
all that is needed to bring back the original perfection of
definition is a quick wash of dilute acid and water. If the
specimens are not rubbed at all the surface is practically permanent.
Blocks so treated reveal a remarkable amount of
detail when examined with a strong hand lens, and form very
valuable museum specimens.</p>
<p>The microscope slides should be covered with glass slips (as
they would naturally be if purchased), and studied under the
microscope as sections of living plants would be.</p>
<p>Microscopic slides of fossils make excellent museum specimens
when mounted as transparencies against a window or
strong light, when a magnifying glass will reveal all but the
last minuti&aelig; of their structure.</p>
<p>4. <i>Labelling</i> and numbering of specimens is very important,
even if the collection be but a small one. As well as the paper
label giving full details, there should be a reference number on
every specimen itself. On the microscope slides this can be cut
with a diamond pencil, and on the stones sealing wax dissolved
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
in alcohol painted on with a brush is perhaps the best medium.
On light-coloured close-textured stones ink is good, and when
quite dry can even be washed without blurring.</p>
<p>The importance of marking the stone itself will be brought
home to one on going through an old collection where the paper
labels have peeled or rubbed off, or their wording been obliterated
by age or mould.</p>
<p>A notebook should be kept in which the numbers are entered,
with a note of all the items on the paper label, and any additional
details of interest.</p>

the internal features of plants; in particular, the relations of the
different tissue systems.</p>
<p class="book"><b>Bracts.</b>&mdash;Organs of the nature of leaves, though not usual foliage
leaves. They often surround fructifications, and are generally
brown and scaly, though they may be brightly coloured or merely
green.</p>

<p class="book"><b>Nature</b>: &ldquo;Of the various books written for children in elementary
schools, <i>The Study of Plant Life</i> is quite the most logical
and intelligent that we have seen&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>Manchester Guardian</b>: &ldquo;With great skill the knowledge gained
from simple experiments in the classroom or laboratory is
made effective.... Our old friend the cactus ... and other
exotic wonders are happily relegated to very subordinate parts
in these bright and attractive pages.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="book"><b>Athen&aelig;um</b>: &ldquo;The author has attained simplicity of language&mdash;a
more difficult business than writers of textbooks imagine&mdash;and
as the book is printed in large, clear type, we can strongly
recommend it to teachers in schools&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>Inquirer</b>: &ldquo;Is a delightful book, beautifully illustrated&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>Scotsman</b>: &ldquo;The book is a charming guide for the youthful
botanist or naturalist to the life history of plants, and it is
written with a due regard to the age of those for whom it
is intended&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>Knowledge</b>: &ldquo;An excellent book for young people desirous of
learning the why and wherefore of plant life&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>New Age</b>: &ldquo;We have seen nothing produced on this side of the
Atlantic so good of its kind&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="book"><b>New Phytologist</b>: &ldquo;... may be unhesitatingly pronounced a
great success ... written with a breadth and knowledge
he has not met before in an English elementary work&rdquo;.</p>
